      "['Director McQueen, drawing on the visual aesthetic of his previous works Shame and Hunger, never shies away from frames that capture the ways that beauty exists in the most painful situations.', \"12 Years a Slave is, like The Trial, a trapdoor over the abyss. Although less abrupt than Kafka's novel, the movie wastes little time before plunging its viewer into a nightmare of dehumanization.\", 'Ambitious, honest and horrifying all at once, 12 Years a Slave may not be the easiest film to watch more than once, but it will stay with you forever once you see it.', 'Add the visionary direction by Steve McQueen, the British Turner Prize-winning artist turned film-maker (Hunger, Shame) and you have an out-and-out stunner.', 'A significant, necessary piece of work, one that stays with you long after you rise out of your theater seat.', \"Movies can do a great many things - they can make us laugh, or incite our heroism, or frighten us, or make us cry. '12 Years a Slave' makes us feel, deeply and urgently.\", 'It speaks to the courage and resilience of one man, the savagery of many, and the potential, for both good and for ill, in us all.', \"McQueen depicts the horrific experiences of Solomon Northup, the free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, in utterly unflinching fashion. The film's strength lies in its frankness and avoidance of either sentimentality or Quentin Tarantino-style irony.\", \"In its own saintly manner, it's as exploitative as anything critics accused Django Unchained of being, minus Tarantino's eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor.\", 'The film tells an irresistibly powerful story, in a way that does not shirk the horror. It is unbearable to watch at times, but that is as it should be.', \"You will recoil. You will flinch. You will say to yourself, 'Oh no, not again.' But the story will seize you with such a visceral power you will be rooted to the spot. I know I was and I'm not easy to root.\", 'A film that, despite its surface simplicity, proves to be riven with contradictions to the point of incoherence.', 'Ejiofor proves himself a master of physical understatement, the clench of his teeth and slightest parting of the lips speaking volumes.', \"A tale of suffering, endurance, courage and abiding humanity about a freeborn man kidnapped and sold into slavery, which packs all the more wallop for the elegance with which it's made.\", \"Ejiofor projects extraordinary integrity, even nobility - and he holds the camera magnificently. It's a deeply inward, deeply felt performance, surely a cert for one of the many Oscars this film must win.\", 'The American South\\'s \"peculiar institution\" has, it seems, become a fit topic for narrative cinema. And it only took a century.', \"12 Years a Slave proves McQueen's formal prowess and, more significantly, his utter seriousness as a dramatist.\", \"12 Years a Slave isn't simply a masterpiece, it's a milestone. This, at last, really is history written with lightning.\", 'Twelve Years a Slave is a magnificent achievement and it is a career best for everyone involved, not least its artist-turned-director, Steve McQueen.', 'The whole film breathes with reality, even while the bayou landscapes are infernalised, surrealised, by a terrible beauty of vision.']\n"
