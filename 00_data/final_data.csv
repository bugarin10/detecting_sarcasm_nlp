 The King's Speech ,2,"Firth strikes a perfect balance between his abrasive traits and the vulnerability that coaxes our empathy. , Travel without prejudice and you will enjoy a moving, impeccably acted and surprisingly funny slice of comfort food. There are worse ways of starting an unpromising looking year., Its an uplifting audience pleaser that also showcases film-making arts and crafts at an exalted level., The Kings Speech is a joy, and I adore it., The film is richly rooted, with splendid trappings, including pea-soup fogs. For all the pomp and protocol, its an intimate story about a scared man who must find his voice if he is to rise, in regal stature, above his epaulets., Hooper...has become something of a specialist in exhuming British history from the mothballs of Masterpiece Theatre., A polite, occasionally rousing, and more often than not, boring affair., A charming, personal period drama., A powerful back story does not necessarily improve a movie, but The Kings Speech has a pretty irresistible one. It might even end with a dramatic night at the Oscars in February., Classic, rousing entertainment loaded with both humor and poignancy., The Kings Speech is the rare work of art thats also an immense crowdpleaser., Too ingratiating to resonate deeply., The Kings Speech is admirably free of easy answers and simple, happy endings; its a skewed, awards-ready version of history, but one polished to a fine, satisfying shine., The Kings Speech is simultaneously cozy and majestic., The Kings Speech is the epitome of prestige cinema, an impeccably crafted and emotionally compelling drama that deserves the many laurels it surely will receive., Its the sort of thing we do awfly well., Although he plays up the odd-couple comedy, Hooper knows how to bring out the anguish behind the humour., The true-life story of a kings efforts to overcome his stammer in order to face his public, constructed like a contemporary makeover narrative., Not just one of the most entertaining British films in years, but one of the most intriguing, too., By the films end I was in tears: a pathetic critic-thing whimpering in the half-dark, knocked into resistlessness by the power of storytelling."
 Black Swan ,1,"What were they trying to say? What happened?... Youre all pretending you know what it means., The impeccable casting adds an elevated element of reality to a film that already hits so close to home., This is part horror, part thriller, part Freudian nightmare and not a pretty film, as I said, nor an easy watch, but its so unexpected and out there and passionate it keeps you with it and involved all the way., Director Darren Aronofskys darkly enthralling entertainment makes the perfect antidote to too many sugary holiday Nutcrackers., By the end, Ninas quest for perfection-and Portmans blazing performance-will leave you breathless., Audiences wont know who to trust and what is real in this terrifyingly great film that will grab hold of you until the final act., For all his command of adrenalized, propulsive narrative and his dazzling technical facility, Aronofskys study in female hysteria ultimately favors frenzy over compassion or insight-and remains strictly skin-deep., Portman hasnt been this good since her early performances in The Professional and Heat, and is deservedly attracting intense Oscar buzz. Kunis brings to Lily a savvy sexiness, and Cassel is entertainingly smarmy., An exercise in the higher kitsch, a slick, pretentious film in which the polished surface is a distorting mirror., It is compelling viewing, aided enormously by Portmans extraordinarily subtle and emotionally authentic performance., A ballet melodrama in which it isnt just the body that is threatened with disintegration, but the mind too., Full of sex, drugs, catfights, violence, hallucinations and even some choice girl-on-girl action. What more could you possibly want from a ballet movie?, Fantastically deranged at all times, Darren Aronofskys ballet psycho-melodrama is a glittering, crackling, outrageously pickable scab of a film., The film is lurid, melodramatic, over-the-top - and currently a hot awards favourite. Aronofsky must have hypnotic powers over jurors and voters., With repeat viewings, the thematic subtext slips into focus and the performances take on a new significance. Its not vintage Aronofsky, but its still a tour de force., An extraordinary, intoxicating movie. Its hard, twisted edges may turn off some, but theres no faulting either Aronofskys technical mastery or Portmans flawless performance., A bona fide, trumpet-it-from-the-chimney-pots masterpiece that ALSO happens to be a terrific psychological thriller AND features Meg from Family Guy copping off with Queen Amidala., Practice makes perfectly insane in Black Swan, a tale of one ballerinas psychosexual freakout., Aronofsky lets us thrill in the in the act of creation without ever letting us forget the terrible sacrifices many artists make to entertain us., Portman, saddled with the near-impossible role of an impenetrable heroine we must care for without ever coming close to understanding, delivers career-high work here..."
 Inception ,1,"Inception engaged on a mainly intellectually level, but that isnt to say that film didnt pack an emotional impact., Inception is an intriguing, frustrating film, but ultimately satisfying., This endlessly fascinating swirl of a film could have come only from Nolan, who blends the cerebral twistiness of Memento (his thriller that moves backward in time) with the spectacular action of his Batman megahit, The Dark Knight., Awesome doesnt even begin to describe the sleek, clever, mind-blowing madness that is director Christopher Nolans aptly titled psychological (read: trippy) thriller Inception., A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolans own original screenplay, Inception is the smartest CGI head-trip since The Matrix., Invention runs lower once were on those snowy slopes, and the hard narrative punch keeps disintegrating into a floating cloud of pixels. But what a display they make., The films imaginative freefall is ruinously anchored to a bogus sense of deep feeling., We can only marvel at what writer-director Nolan has thought up and executed so well. But he doesnt know when to stop. Every level leads to another level., Inception is the kind of information-packed movie that creates the painful/pleasurable sensation that theres no time to think., Inception isnt a dud but nor is it a masterpiece. Its like a very ambitious, overlong potboiler: visually beautiful, ingenious in parts and dragging in others., Inception is a grown-up thriller ride through the dreamscapes of the mind, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead. The movie is a sign that Hollywood retains some intellectual oomph., The real cause of wonder, though, is why Nolan should have embraced technocratic complexity in the service of such a puny story., If its the dreamer whose subconscious fills in the details, as the film claims, why the absence of silliness, sex, horror and general abandon?, A heist film of thrilling, almost delirious complexity., Even as you tick off the films overload of references, though -- a Matrix here, a James Bond there -- the amazing effects and Cobbs quest carry you along., Its one thing to simply make up a story, but its another to come up with a scenario and actually make it feel real and thats exactly what Nolan achieves here., An always-tense, extremely suspenseful sci-fi action film that respects a viewers intelligence., Intelligent and imaginative Inception is eye bending and mind bending in equal measures., Nolan is having the time of his life in his own personal playground and, for all its heavy technical and narrative machinery, Inception remains one of his lightest films., It is irritating for an hour, being so gloomily lit that you need fog lights, then it opens up into a marvellously inventive, somewhat silly but enjoyable heist movie, with a good cast doing things I doubt even they could explain."
 The Kids Are All Right ,1,"Say what you will about Lisa Cholodenko, but she and co-writer Stuart Blumberg deserve some major Kudos (the good kind with the chocolate chips) for writing these incredible female characters., Together the performances mark the perfect recipe in a beautifully written story is both funny in the most surprising parts and touching when it needs to be., Its emotional pull remains consistent to the end., A long-form sitcom overly pleased with its own progressiveness., The film joyfully allows us to embrace, rather than escape, the wonderful, awkward embarrassment of familial love., This is a much better made, more persuasive film than The Switch or The Back-Up Plan but just as much about wish fulfilment, and no more honest about conflicts that can leave the kids far from all right., Piercingly funny, subtle and moving., Funny, aching, rueful -- often at the same time -- The Kids Are All Right makes most mainstream releases this year seem decadent by comparison., The film gets better and better, powered by a sharp, wise script and superlative acting., Family-centric comedy has never felt so fresh., A witty portrait of postmodern family life in which script, casting, direction and location all just float together without any apparent effort at all., A witty, warm exploration of family life thats conventional and unconventional in equal measure., The Critics Are All Wrong., The Kids are All Right is funny, touching and honest, all the elements that make independent cinema so much more rewarding, most of the time, than the mainstream., Common to all Cholodenkos films is a fascination with the mayhem that can result when the chronically stitched-up come up against the amoral and fancy-free., Packed with humble family principles. Immensely enjoyable the whole way through and one that delivers values and that warm fuzzy feeling inside to hold on to afterward., Sophisticated and funny, but once you get past the unusual premise and the fact that the main couple is realistically portrayed, theres nothing surprising about it., Its a terrific film., Definitions of family, love and friendship all get put to the test with wit and warmth in The Kids Are All Right, one of the years most honest and endearing films., Its about the slow, inevitable grind of marriage. Its about the eternally unknowable curveballs life throws at you and how you either step up to the plate toward triumph or turn away in tears or terror or both. Its about love."
 127 Hours ,1,"This may be a great film, and an ingenious film, but only if youve the stomach for it., Any film that relies on one actor to carry the movie demands a lot of its leading man but James Franco applies a youthful exuberance that makes him so watchable its all viewers could do not to blink., Franco... delivers a solid performance as the strapping climber who shows his vulnerability when he reflects back on his life--the mistakes hes made and the moments he may miss., Its an incredible performance by Franco, walking the line between what once was enthusiasm but now is manic desperation., As a follow-up to Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours shows Danny Boyle at the top of his form -- its not a story many filmmakers would want to tackle, and few would handle it as well., That director Danny Boyle makes us feel the shock of relief as Ralston finally pulls away from his stony prison signals just how immersive a piece of first-person story-telling this is., Boyles film takes us back to the campfire for a story that is painful and powerful, as well as true., At its centre is a magnificent performance from James Franco..., At the end, we stagger like Ralston from the dark into the light. We might have both our arms left, but our nerves are just as terrorised., Danny Boyle cant help but return, over and over again, to material thats heavy on physical pain, mental paranoia and personal treachery., In taking a Movie of the Week plotline and giving it a technical supercharge, Boyle has restated his case among the front rank of filmmakers., Franco acts his heart and soul out, as Ryan Reynolds did in Buried, a similar one-man agony opera in a confined space., A film that no sane movie exec would ever commission. Fortunately for us, though, there are no sane movie execs., A surprisingly fun, effervescent against-the-odds drama that offers an upbeat moral without the usual punishing survival-story clichs. Not for the faint-hearted, mind., Boyle is such a gifted filmmaker that, in his hands, 127 Hours is genuinely -- and unsentimentally -- inspirational., Boyle has always been an exceptionally stylish director, and, despite its limited setting, 127 Hours is a marvel of visual eye candy., Directed and co-written by Danny Boyle in a style that travels from ecstatic to nerve-wracking and back, this is a film about perseverance, strength and the importance of always letting people know where youre going., Fair warning, oh squeamish ones: 127 Hours does not shy away from (nor does it stint on) Ralstons ultimate method of obtaining egress from his predicament. Which is exactly as it should be., It will blow you away -- for its audacity; for James Francos performance; for the way that, by the end, it leaves you feeling connected to the strangers sitting next to you, and happier to be part of humankind., Shiver-making moments aside, in a important way 127 Hours suffers from the filmmakers lack of nerve, a reluctance to let the audience taste Ralstons dread and the expectation of a slow, absurd death."
 The Social Network ,1,"In its cold, almost forensic way, this is as tense and exciting as it is absorbing. Its a miracle, really., The Social Network, just like its subject, is the pop culture phenomenon of the new generation., Fincher does, at least, make decent entertainment out of such inherently unprepossessing subjects as computer use and legal hearings., The Social Network is splendid entertainment from a master storyteller, packed with energetic incident and surprising performances., At last, a movie you can actually discuss afterward. And not just on Facebook or Twitter. No, youll want to chew it over in person, with friends, for hours., Like Zuckerberg, Fincher excels at data management, delivering vast amounts of information with the utmost clarity and speed., Its a shamelessly biased account, as well as a seductively plausible one, although you have to keep your wits about you to get the full effect., In his first venture over to the dark side, the central performance by Jesse Eisenberg is a revelation. Its Oscar-worthy stuff., David Finchers fast-paced business drama adopts the set-up of his 1999 film Fight Club and inverts it., Despite the fun of the parties, the intrigue of the legal wranglings and the humour of the dialogue, Fincher and Sorkin never let us forget that were complicit in their story (or at least 500 million of us are)., Business hasnt been this exciting since Gordon Gekkos first outing., A rich, understated character drama that gleefully exposes the petty playground politics at the centre of one of the internet-eras most bitter court cases., The film is almost nothing but scenes of people sitting over glowing screens, or in lawyers offices, or in bars/diners/clubs. Yet it never seems sedentary. The jabber is intensive., The Social Network is one of the movies for which 2010 will be remembered., The films real achievement stretches beyond the story. When weve all forgotten Facebook, The Social Network will remind us what it was to be part of the generation of Millenials., A business procedural played with the intensity of a thriller and the ingenuity of a screwball comedy., The movies lustrous, deep-focus frames and headlong pace are difficult to resist. Its an entertainingly cynical small movie., Finchercrafts a document that analyzes who we are now and where were at in a way no other motion picture up to now has, and for that reason alone that probable makes the film a masterpiece., You will know The Social Network is something very special from its first scene., The Social Network shares creative DNA with a handful of classic, zeitgeist-savvy films like Network and All the Presidents Men, as well as more recent fare such as The Insider and Michael Clayton."
 Toy Story 3 ,1,"The ostensibly inanimate objects are far more animated than most movie stars., It takes a kind of genius to combine a childrens movie for grown-ups and a grown-ups movie for children in one glittering digimated package, yet the folks at Pixar have done it time and again., Action-wise, this is essentially a prison-break caper, but there is so much more to it than this., When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl, the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure -- a concise, deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting., There are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison-break movies, but the Pixar gang gets at the most primary fear -- being cast off and no longer of use., I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer., You can intellectualise and even defend the reasons why the film is disappointing, but that doesnt stop it being disappointing., Its still more inventive, clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now., A kids movie for grown-ups. A grown-up movie for kids. Exactly what youd expect -- and hope for -- from the latest, and were guessing final, Woody and Buzz adventure., Comes across at once as a tender, thoughtful valedictory and a symbolic renewal., By Pixars high standards this isnt the best, but by anyone elses, its close to perfection., I tried stuffing paper into my nose and into my mouth and in my ears to stop the flow. It was hopeless. Toy Story 3 is not only a masterpiece but is the most heart-rending film I have ever seen., The perfect film does not, and cannot, exist. But if it did, it would probably look a lot like this., Its an effortlessly superior family movie., Its a film that moves as much as it entertains, that will make adults cry as much as -- perhaps even more than -- younger children., The Toy Story films are deservedly seen as the gold standard for computer-generated animation..., If there were a Nobel Prize for Digital Animation it would have been won almost every year by Pixar., Its sadder and scarier than its predecessors, but it also may be the most important chapter in the tale., The best movie of the year so far., The 3D animation is quite beautiful, and theres the usual bonus of a Pixar short film before the feature, the clever and enchanting Night and Day."
 True Grit ,1,"I thought the film was excellent... But Dont skimp on the development of female characters just because the complexities are difficult to represent. Were going to notice., Henry Hathaways 1969 adaptation was highly faithful... The Coens movie is less faithful than Hathaways but stronger - the production, by their regular team, is formally superb - and weirder., Disappointing overall, though entertaining at times, True Grit isnt exactly the Coen brothers best movie but they get an A for effort., With his leisurely growl, somewhere between trail-grizzled and post-nap, Bridges sounds as if hes talking through his collar, in a vocal performance thats entertaining no matter what hes saying., , Jeff Bridges is rough and rowdy marshal Ruben Rooster Cogburn, and manages to put his own stamp on the role made famous in 1969 by John Wayne. It\s no surprise that he knows how to bring a wide palette of colors to this character, and he seems to be..., This True Grit is timeless., The Coen brothers excellent western True Grit is a second and rather different version of Charles Portiss novel, rather than a remake of the 1969 film that brought John Wayne an Oscar as the one-eyed bounty hunter Marshal Rooster Cogburn., True Grit is the third film the Coen brothers have made since the triumph of No Country for Old Men. Its just as characteristic and deserves just as much success., At an uncertain time for heroes in America, theres no wonder its packing em in., It meanders along, convinced of its own idiosyncratic suavity, never venturing out of its makers comfort zones., This True Grit is a very impressive piece of work, beautifully photographed by Roger Deakins, and if you had never seen the original, it might be getting even higher praise., A series of photogravures formed into an elegant, high-toned flip book., It could be the Coens most straightforward film, but its also one of their best., Imagine you heard the Coen brothers had gone and made a straight-up Western. Now imagine Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin and Matt Damon were in it. As movie news goes, thats on a par with Christina Hendricks signing up for the Piranha 3D sequel., Terrific: tough, exciting, funny, gorgeous and bewitchingly acted, this is darn close to perfection., Steinfeld more than holds her own in this high callibre company, shining in her role, as the Coens shift the focus of the film on to her character to mirror the original novels style., Delivers a perfectly fine, character-driven revenge yarn before unaccountably falling into a heap in its final act., Jeff Bridges aint the Duke, no sir, but the Duke werent Jeff Bridges, neither., The old-school American western was not dead, it seems. It was just playing possum, waiting for the Coens to come along and rouse it."
 Winter's Bone ,1,"Debra Graniks bleak little film is as tough, unflinching and fascinating as the characters who eke out a life amid its cold, gray hills., A rewarding, richly detailed exploration of the strength of character required when confronted by ugly truths., The Coen Brothers O Brother Where Art Thou? was the last film to make such delirious use of mountain music. The rest of the world can start drooling over Lawrence. Im gonna git me a copy of that soundtrack., The film, adapted by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, establishes a formidable tension between mystery and matter-of-factness., There is poetry here -- as artists as diverse as Walker Evans, James Agee and Harry Smith have found -- of the rawest, most desperate kind., It is all given unironic dignity and power due to the outstanding lead performance from 20-year-old Jennifer Lawrence as Ree, a young woman who must take on some scary neighbourhood types to protect her family., Think a film like Trash Humpers offers insight into a crappy life in the poor South? Winters Bone will make you see the light., A vivid reworking of Daniel Woodrells novel that brings the books conflicted heroine to searing life in a piece of unhurried filmmaking too rarely seen these days., Granik balances the pace and intrigue of a mystery thriller with total compassion for Ree, played with much skill by Lawrence., Like a Botoxed face, the movie never shows an interesting wrinkle or passion-attesting lifeline., Its a tight, gripping mystery with a well-chosen supporting cast and countless great little moments, such as a supremely spooky sing-song at a birthday party., Its bleak, slow moving … but in its gradual, aimless way it ratchets up the tension to terrific heights, and its climactic twists come home with the force of a shotgun blast., This unblinking look at Americas Red State Crystal Meth Belt is an instant Southern Gothic classic., Winters Bone is a genuine triumph, a great movie with astounding performances so natural, so genuine, that you forget its a movie., What weve been waiting for: a work of art that grabs hold and wont let go., With Winters Bone, Granik has morphed from a director worth watching to one who demands our undivided attention. Shes got mine., The result is a film and a character of unusual strength. Pity Ree, question her decisions, wonder about her future. But the girl does not quit., Jennifer Lawrence gives a stirring turn in a gift-of-a-lifetime role., A masterpiece of sparseness., Winters Bone is the kind of film that should be offered to us more often."
 The Descendants ,1,"I liked it. I enjoyed it. I did not resent the time Id spent watching it, although that may just be because I seriously have nothing better to do., The Descendants is humane, decent, and close to real quality., The film plays to Paynes strengths - not just the emotional complexity and the constantly shifting kaleidoscope of moods, but his skill at eliciting in-depth performances from his cast., Few films have dealt with the concept of parental death as movingly, poetically and lovingly as this, delivering a strikingly powerful narrative that is as profound as it is honest., Paynes interest is the human drama: hes very much the director-as-novelist and The Descendants has all the satisfactions of a story well told., As is the way with Paynes films, we go away feeling that every man is an island - and its only a matter of time before each of us finds ourselves deserted., The saving notes are the films minutiae. There are dialogue moments in Paynes drollest, enemies-on-edge style., Worth the wait. Dont stay away for so long next time though, Alex., This sweet, sad new film from Alexander Payne holds a promise of gentleness that is fulfilled, and a promise of complexity that isnt., Payne is an unobtrusive director, a filmmaker who lets the script do the walking - in this case, perhaps too much., A marvellous follow-up to 2004s Sideways - well worth the wait., Wants to be mature but cant help shortchanging its drama through constant reliance on its protagonists unimpeachable nobility., The challenge in describing the film is that it doesnt neatly fit into any pigeonhole. Its a serious movie that happens to have a sense of humor, because Payne and his collaborators see the absurdity in everyday existence., The Descendants is beautifully shot (by Phedon Papamichael) and compellingly performed, especially by its young stars, and it has moments of startling tenderness. If only it didnt feel phony to its bones., One of the years best films, a bubbly meditation on family and responsibility that weighs just enough to matter., In the hands of writer-director Alexander Payne, Clooney has rarely seemed so much at home., In playing an everyman stranded between anger and duty, Clooney earns an emotional payoff that a lesser actor would simply demand., With so many balls in the air the temptation is to rush from one plot strand to another, but Payne takes the opposite approach. He also captures the complexity of emotional reactions that grief stirs., Its Clooney and Woodleys movie, as they become a team before our eyes., The latest exhibit in Payne\s careful dissection of the beached male, which runs from Matthew Broderick\s character in Election to Jack Nicholson\s in About Schmidt and Paul Giamatti\s in Sideways."
 Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close ,1,"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close just doesnt seen to have any point, and is sentimental and banal as well as very, very long., Daldry delivers a surprisingly engaging adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foers stridently voiced novel about a precocious boy dealing with the death of his father in the terror attacks., In the end, the movie is about healing and coming to understand that some things cant be explained., The situation is wrenching in too many ways at once. You sit there, first cringing, then fighting back, out of primitive self-respect., So slow and self-important that its Academy Award Best Picture nomination only proves that the shortlist is too long..., Fascinating despite itself. Which every way you fall, this will provoke a strong reaction., An intensely self-conscious movie that contrives to make the human cost and human meaning of 9/11 distant and faint., You rather end up wishing Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close would just pipe down and back off., Less a film about communication, in the end, than one with its fingers in its ears., Its challenging, divisive and has moments of beauty but leaves you cold., I wont say Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is perfect but I will say I adored and loved it with all my being nonetheless., Jonathan Safran Foers acclaimed novel about a boy whose father was killed in the World Trade Center on 9/11 has been brought to the screen with great sensitivity and heart., ...the cure for Oskars severe case of shell-shock, in Eric Roths adaptation of the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, seems artificial and contrived to me., As a portrait of what happens to a family when its glue disappears, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close wrung a bucket of tears out of me., Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is the kind of movie you want to punch in the nose., If imagining a city where people open their doors (or dont) to a boy with a key and a ton of questions is sentimental ... then it is vitally, beautifully so., Stephen Daldrys extremely labored and incredibly crass adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foers novel., The difficulty is mainly with the story, which despite all the emotion hovering around it, remains thin and uninvolving., It gets far too cute., Its a genuinely moving and often lovely piece of work - beautifully acted and, ultimately, earning its tears."
 The Help ,1,"Yes it has drawn some criticism for not being authentic enough in depicting the painful disparity, but in putting rarely heard voices on screen and telling it in a story as regonisable as this, The Help deserves only praise., The Help is a somewhat light-hearted take on the relations between black maids and their bosses in 1960s Mississippi, giving a simplified yet well-intended story of Kathryn Stockettâ€™s novel for the big screen., At one point, Minny rhapsodizes about fried chicken and the solace of its preparation... I was convinced the movie was satirical., But aside from its substantial performances, The Helps completely uninteresting script caused the whole movie to be dead on arrival., They collectively drive this films engine, and as ensembles go this is the best one Im likely to see assembled in all of 2011., There are some magnificent elements here... The downside is the mawkishness and the rambling narrative structure., It tackles a challenging, inflammatory subject in the corniest, safest way possible., In dramatic terms it works a treat., Suffers from an obsequious lust for stereotypes., Terrifically performed, with enough humour and heart that youll ignore its flaws., The Help not only has its cake and eats it, it makes short work of the fried chicken, grits and sweet potato pie, too., Yes, it gets a bit sentimental. Yes, some Ya-Ya Sisterhood friendship clichés creep in. Yes, it glosses history. But its also heartfelt, hilarious and the cast is a dream-team topped by Viola Davis., Sure, its corny, but it mostly works., if you get to the end of this movie without tearing up at least once, please check for a pulse; you might already be dead., If you lived through that time, it is incredible to contemplate how much has changed (and how much hasnt) over the years, not only in race relations but in attitudes toward women. Thats part of the fascination of watching The Help, which..., The film production elements are iffy at best: The lighting is too bright. The costumes dont seem real. Skeeters obtrusive wig looks like a mop. The musical score is not an asset., If you lived through that time, it is incredible to contemplate how much has changed (and how much hasnt) over the years, not only in race relations but in attitudes toward women. Thats part of the fascination of watching The Help..., The Help takes us on a pop-cultural tour that savors the picturesque, and strengthens stereotypes it purports to shatter., Thanks to a talented cast -- starting with leads Emma Stone, Viola Davis\u200b and Octavia Spencer\u200b -- the movie is often entertaining. But The Help should have been challenging too., It has an overmodest debutantes aversion to any ugliness."
 Hugo ,1,"The first thing to say... is that it is a visual wonder... But the second thing to say is nothing else is as exciting as the look of it and if there is a third thing it is this: Hugo himself is rather boringly bland and I didnt much care for him., It is a miraculous achievement that, during this home stretch, engages on levels and in ways few other films can admit to, and as such makes a decided case to be considered as one of the years finest achievements., Being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isnt a prerequisite for walking in the door. A sense of wonder, however, is., Hugo is an intensely personal statement from Scorsese, one not just about magic, but also the magic of cinema., Leave it to Martin Scorsese to use 3-D not as a gimmick, but as a means of drawing us into a unique and magical environment..., Hugo is cinema shining a light reverently up its own fundament., Scorsese transforms this innocent tale into an ardent love letter to the cinema and a moving plea for film preservation., Hugos best moments are those that arent actually Hugo., It is glorious to be thrown and blown about in this make-believe metropolis. The digitally enhanced shapes and colours suggest Jeunet and Caro reworked by a polychromatic Piranesi., Its possible to see the attraction, but when people break into applause over the credits, some are going to be left cold., Its a deeply felt piece of work, something which only Scorsese could have brought to the screen..., Hugo is nothing short of gorgeous., It might be curtains for celluloid, but Scorsese, a boyish 69, clearly isnt leaving the stage any time soon. He directs every film with the passion of his first. And it shows., This love letter to the movies is something to cherish., Thematic potency and cinematic virtuosity -- the production was designed by Dante Ferretti and photographed by Robert Richardson -- cant conceal a deadly inertness at the films core., This is a great directors greatest love story., For all the wizardry on display, Hugo often feels like a film about magic instead of a magical film..., I have seen the future of 3-D moviemaking, and it belongs to Martin Scorsese, unlikely as that may sound., Its a fairy tale for mature viewers, but the airy exterior hides emotional depth., One of the most magical viewing experiences of the decade so far."
 Midnight in Paris ,1,"Midnight In Paris isnt a film about peering into a crystal ball. Its a movie about seeing beyond the headlines and looking toward a place and its people. Its humble as pie -- and all the more enriching for it., A week is too short a time frame. A longer view might have left a deeper impression."
 Moneyball ,1,"Like a long, boring game of chess, where hopeful baseball players are discarded as effortlessly as a pawn and a knight, Moneyball fails to provide the sentiment it needs to inspire audiences., Moneyball is a winner, one of the freshest and smartest sports movies in years., Brad Pitt is at the top of his own game as Beane. Cocky and often nonchalant, he is gnawed by doubts that he tries to cover by grabbing a snack or pitching a grin., I couldnt take my eyes off of it, and as emotionally interior and as dialogue driven as much of it the whole thing ends up being as thrilling as a big budget action blockbuster and as compelling as your typical star-powered Hollywood melodrama., Its an engaging, almost exotic film., Brad Pitt in a dugout. Oh dear; oh dear. Here is baseball, reel upon reel and inning upon inning., What were left with is a sporadically entertaining mess. Moneyball is unsure about what (if any) risks it should take., An accomplished, bracingly intelligent film that scores points on all fronts..., Its the best film about statistics youre ever likely to see., As an example of smarter-than-average Hollywood fare - and a sly dig at modern sporting politics - Moneyball has all the key bases covered., You dont need to understand anything of baseball to get behind this, a chest-swelling story about second chances and flipping a finger up (even a giant foam one) to The Man., I kept hoping for something about the film to surprise me. Very little did., Recognizes that sometimes, happily-ever-afters are more complicated than uplifting Hollywood films can manage., One of the most soulful of baseball movies -- it confronts the anguish of a very tough game., Moneyball is a film about losers, but when those losers do manage to pull out a win, its truly something to cheer., If you want action and chills during the big game, Moneyball comes in under par. But, if youre okay with a behind-the-scenes look via deliberate conversations, it opens up a new wing of the genre., The real protagonist of Moneyball, however, is Beane himself, played with great charisma by Brad Pitt., Pitt provides ballast and a swaggering humor to a movie that, too often, strives to be The Social Network of baseball movies., Pitt, who has a producing credit, is not the sole reason this tremendous -- yet intimate -- sports tale soars over the fences. The bench is deep. And the script has a powerful but finessed swing., Moneyball turns an unlikely subject interesting, making a professional sport the nexus where past and future collide."
 The Tree of Life ,1,"Malicks earnest pretentiousness surely invites derisive laughter. But it also withstands it, and like the ancient evergreen of its title, it towers benevolently over less ambitious movies..., The Tree of Life in no way measured up., Ideally, you would bathe in a film like this without striving to decipher it. As its a film about what we cant get our heads around, we are probably not meant to get our heads round it. But, even so, it is so audacious it will take your breath away., ... its too bad what could have been a beautifully crushing family drama was usurped by a massive amount of unnecessary special effects clouding the real story., The tone of the film is mesmeric, transcendent, awe-inspiring., Its difficult to shake the sense of it as the spectacle of a man gone deep-sea diving in his own navel., Nobody else but Malick could have made it. Few would even dare to try., An extraordinary vision of first contact, not between two cultures but between a soul and the universe., One for the history books., The Tree Of Life pushes American cinema into regions uncharted since Stanley Kubricks heyday., All that really emerges is that Terrence Malick...has, Stanley Kubrick-style, fermented into a filmmaker with a glacial output who begs to be deciphered rather than enjoyed., There is simply nothing like it out there: profound, idiosyncratic, complex, sincere and magical; a confirmation that cinema can aspire to art., You dont watch The Tree Of Life so much as loll in front of it. Its part puzzle, part coming-of-age tale, part wildlife documentary, and all mind-blowing., This films rewards are many, for those with the patience to simply let it float., Sections of Malicks expansive, fitfully brilliant, occasionally sloppy film are so powerful that you can only gaze up at the screen in wordless awe., In this flawed yet masterful, unforgettable movie, Malick argues that even the tiniest mote can have value. He sees miracles everywhere. You just have to make an effort to see them, too., Glibly put, this challenging time-skipping rumination is the big screen equivalent of watching that Tree grow., The Tree of Life is rooted in human nature but ascends to the infinite mystery. It\s a dizzying climb with few footholds for the timid or cynical, but the view from above is heavenly., The result actually plays like a divine pronouncement, cosmic in scope and oracular in tone, a cinematic sermon on the mount that shows its creator in exquisite form. Exquisite but frustrating., The vision is dazzling. The portrayal of family life palpable. The ending ... well, lets go back to the vision."
 War Horse ,1,"Spielberg is mindful of the family audience, but still captures the misery of trench combat., This is always emotionally obvious, as well as consistently predictable. Something important has been lost in translation that cannot be compensated for by realism or pictorial beauty., Not entirely satisfying … Somehow, though, the sum of the parts are more than the whole … It is a film of a kind we dont see any more, that it would be good to see more of., If any movie released in 2011 screams, Oscar Bait!, louder than Steve Spielberg\s War Horse than I haven\t seen it., War Horse is a pre-packaged brand, rather than a movie., We are marched through cloying kidult rhetoric for 150 minutes, ending with the inevitable pull on our hankie pocket, as wheedling as a beggar pulling on our change pocket. The only difference: the beggar is more deserving., This is a soaring, sprawling epic that harks back to the dream-big visionaries of old Hollywood: John Ford, David Lean, David O. Selznick., Heavy-handed melodrama with flashes of brilliance., Spielberg still manages to surprise and impress., War Horse is bold, exquisite family filmmaking in the grandest Hollywood tradition., The trouble here is not so much that Spielbergs film staunchly insists on finding a happy ending even in the calamity of the First World War, but that he slathers it on so thick and leaves so soft an impression., The material sometimes feels oversugared, though its also guaranteed to raise a lump in your throat., Tthe images have what I can only describe as a wonderful texture. They also have intense color: deep gemlike greens and reds, with black shadows out of an old master painting., We never ask why the production is devoted to an animal while ten million men are dying, but when Spielberg does the story realistically, it seems trivial, even a little daft., Amid the incomprehensible slaughter, its a horse that reminds these warriors of their humanity., A film that may stay in the minds eye longer than it lingers in the heart., It is a work by a master, but it is not a masterpiece., There isnt a moment in the movie where you dont feel Spielbergs passion, and this time, the film is worthy of his enthusiasm. Its a knockout., Tonally jarring and structurally disjointed, its a punishingly long and bumpy ride., War Horse is the law of diminishing returns in action."
 Argo ,2,"Affleck continues to impress audiences with his keen eye for direction, knowing just when to fall back and allow this top-notch cast the freedom to interpret the events in a way that will most compel viewers., Affleck is still building up his chops as a director, but the intelligence and ambition he brings to filmmaking are particularly apparent in Argo., The old saw truth is stranger than fiction has had its teeth properly sharpened in the superb thriller Argo, a blend of political history and Hollywood hijinks that goes right for the jugular., The emotional catharsis of Argo isnt what happens onscreen, but the sheer knowledge that the creaky old moviemaking system has put together something this crowd-pleasing and great., Ben Affleck has delivered a knuckle-muncher of a thriller and a satire on Hollywood, both in one unlikely package., Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. And sometimes it isnt, and it must be bent and twisted out of shape until any authenticity becomes purely theoretical., The cast helps to keep things moving -- particularly the hilarious interplay between Arkin and Goodman. And is it me, or should Bryan Cranston be in every film released?, Only two scenes do more than hint at the poetic potential of the premise., Lets just say that the movies final section is so nail-bitingly tense, thanks to a skillful combination of acting, writing and crosscutting, that it puts Affleck in the big leagues as a director., Entertaining and suspenseful in old-fashioned ways., Affleck himself turns in a quietly impressive movie star performance. Tony Mendez is a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists., The details make for a rip-roaring story, which Affleck invests with old-school directorial élan., Surprisingly enjoyable, given that you may have little prior commitment to this story and only mildly fancy Affleck., Talent borrows and genius steals, but Affleck does something in between: he mimics., Its impossible to be bored by a story this good, especially with that cast., Part of what makes this headspinning story believable is the fact that it pans out in an oddly uncomplicated way., There is an intelligent, funny film waiting to come out of this story; it will have to keep waiting., With Afflecks continued growth as a director, it makes you want to see what he will deliver next., For 100 minutes, Argo is close to flawless., As a director, Ben Affleck is getting into Alan Pakula territory."
 Amour ,1,"What makes Amour not only bearable but cathartic is the beauty of the filmmaking and the delicacy of the performances., If only some of the uninhibitedly energetic thought and insight of these actors had found its way into Hanekes movie., Haneke has taken the ordinary - getting old; dying; happens to us all; no exceptions - and has transformed it into something so literate, powerful, terrifying, intelligent and extraordinary., What Haneke give us with Amour is a love story, one that is compassionate, powerful and intelligent, and that treats its protagonists and its audiences with respect., Scene after scene is an exquisite masterclass of astonishing acting., Beautifully shot, powerfully acted, and skillfully composed, Amour is worth pursuing., This is realism that enlarges our conception of the term., Now at the end of the year comes a masterpiece, not just the best of the year, but one of the best ever: Michael Hanekes Amour., This is a profound look at love about a couple who have lived with each other for so many years, know each other so well and this terrible thing that is facing them and theres a serenity there which makes it even more moving, I think., Ultimately, the title of the film demands to be taken as a question: is this truly what love looks like? A little smugly, Haneke refuses to answer., Trintignant perfectly captures the resolve that eventually borders on obsession, as the woman he loves gradually, maddeningly, disappears before his eyes, and he does whatever he can to prevent it, though he knows its impossible., Many viewers will find echoes of their grandparents, parents, or even themselves in these characters., A movie that is utterly worthy of its all-encompassing title., The resulting interplay of ruthless restraint and unavoidable passion, plus the films refusal to shrink from depicting the inevitable horrors of physical deterioration, is devastating., In many ways its the best horror film Ive ever seen. At the same time, its hard to recommend; I believe I will be struggling to forget this film as long as I live. I doubt Ill succeed., It is an inspirational film in the truest sense, and one to see with someone you love., As remarkable as Hanekes films are, not a one has been as transcendently generous as Amour, which is nominated for five Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best foreign-language film., Death is part of loves bargain, and Haneke lays this fact bare., Amour isn\t easy to watch, but its rewards are many., Amour isn\t just a great movie, it\s a movie that may actually do you some good."
 Beasts of the Southern Wild ,1,"The brilliant, original four-hankie dystopian family drama from New Orleans newcomer Benh Zeitlin far surpassed any expectations for a scruffy $1.5 million effort from an unknown film collective..., The movies mad gusto is truly infectious., It will not only stir your soul, but also open your mind to the possibility of a real-life Promised Land., Beasts of the Southern Wild, a deliciously dreamy tale about a fictional Bayou community in the backwaters of Louisiana, does not so much jump off the screen as float effortlessly off it., Its an amazing vision. A work of art., What is also extraordinary is that almost all the people we see are actors. So this is not a documentary but a moving enactment by people who are themselves moved., Beasts of the Southern Wild is sheer poetry on screen: an explosion of joy in the midst of startling squalor and one of the most visceral, original films to come along in a while., When can we watch it again?, It doesnt ultimately make any sense at all and, for me, its charm wasnt enough to sustain the whole ramshackle structure., Like a series of dippy postcards sent by an enraptured child from a disaster zone., Benh Zeitlins debut feature is part film, part hallucination: a ripe and gamey piece of what you might call Apocalyptic Southern Gothic, ambitious and flawed but sprinting with energy., Few American debuts in recent years have announced a talent as singular as that of Behn Zeitlin, the blazingly gifted director and co-writer of Beasts of the Southern Wild., A dreamy but strikingly immediate and frayed-at-the-edges, childs-eye view of life on the margins of America., Beautiful, funny, timely and tender, this is the American arthouse movie of the year., Well, despite the camera work, Im giving it three and a half., A beautiful, strange tone poem about childhood and innocence., The atmosphere Zeitlin develops here is moist with promise and danger, and he moves back and forth between outright fable and pungent reality with an astounding sureness of vision for a first-time director., Beasts of the Southern Wild is a film to get lost in., Beasts is film as natural mystery museum., Hushpuppy exists fully in whatever moment she happens to find herself in. Its a jaw-droppingly good performance from this pint-sized, first-time actor."
 Django Unchained ,1,"Tarantino designed this revisionist western to blow peoples gaskets. Packed with physical comedy, bloody action and hell-bent revenge, it looks like a classic widescreen Sergio Leone western..., A good film, and a crazily entertaining film, until Tarantino does blow everything up, at which point it just becomes rather silly., The film is at times brilliant but mostly infuriating. It is a good movie in that masturbatory way most Tarantino films are good., Django Unchained is a ruthless and romantic epic that is also filled with unbridled entertainment that challenges audiences, rather than coddling them., Its an intelligently provocative, massively entertaining exercise in postmodern revisionism, highlighting how shamefully few movies Hollywood has ever made about slavery., It was a mixed bag for me; some great moments scattered about amongst lots of humdrum, considering the subject matter., But I absolutely love and was blown away by Django Unchained, and I cant wait to see it again, and again after that., The direction stays firmly within the predictable bounds of Tarantinos violent sensibility, The movie moves, with crispness and intelligence, arriving at the most purely satisfying conclusion we could possibly ask for. Audiences are going to eat that last reel up. I know I did., The horror that Django Unchained expresses isnt of slavery, finally, but of a filmmaker attempting historical tragedy while shackled by his own supercilious persona., Django Unchained is 165 minutes and nothing much happens beyond talk and the provision of corpses. The plot lurches around and the artful structure of Pulp Fiction has been abandoned., Tarantinos best for ages, absolutely not to be missed., Who needs facts when there is great vengeance, furious anger and the path of righteousness to attend to? The magpie deserves our respect. Always. Forever., A piece of have-it-all-ways hokum ..., Not a masterpiece, but a funny, violent, very entertaining crowdpleaser., As in all of Tarantinos best films, there is a strange and brilliant magic at work here; a dark, bubbling alchemy of art and junk., Another strong, sparky and bloody entry in the QT canon., A film bursting with pleasures great and small ..., Django Unchained is Tarantinos most complete movie yet. It is also his most vital. His storytelling talents match the heft of the tale., Django Unchained has mislaid its melancholy, and its bitter wit, and become a raucous romp. It is a tribute to the spaghetti Western, cooked al dente, then cooked a while more, and finally sauced to death."
 Life of Pi ,1,"A boy, and a tiger, and a vast, endless ocean. Ang Lee makes a film out of material that seems almost unfilmable, and a lot of it is quite wondrous., While you are bathing in all the beauty, you are waiting and waiting and waiting for this film to say something, yet when it finally does... it all just feels empty somehow., Lee shows his heros imperilled position as a mixed blessing. By tottering on the ledge of his mortality, Pi gains a front-row seat on the miracles of creation... All this is, in a word, Awesome., Veteran filmmakers will warn you, dont film at sea and dont work with animals. Ang Lee built a vast tank in Taiwan and he whips up awesome storms. However, watching the water here is more rewarding than watching the characters., When adrift with Pi and the tiger on the open sea, the film is at its most wondrous: a ravishing spectacle that treads judiciously on the infinite line between whats possible and impossible., Lee is a wizard, Life of Pi is an incredible spectacle and the technical effects are brilliant., Life of Pi is chiefly to be recommended for the punch of its core story. Never mind the cod-philosophical breadth - feel the impressive emotional depth., Despite some lovely images and those eyepopping effects, it is a shallow and self-important shaggy-dog story - or shaggy-tiger story - and I am bemused by the saucer-eyed critical responses its been getting., Is Lees film a fable? Is it an adventure? No, its a super-movie., Yes, this is fantasy cinema. One man, alone with his wonderment, suspended between sky and sea., To produce a coherent film from Martels tricky novel would be achievement enough, but Ang Lee has extracted something beautiful, wise and, at times, miraculous., Theres less than meets the eye in Lees ultimately unsatisfying fable., Flawed, yes, but marvellously ambitious, and unforgettably gorgeous to look at., Didnt convince me to believe in God, but it did make me believe in the power of cinema., Mr. Lees film is stronger as a visual experience-especially in 3-D-than an emotional one, but it has a final plot twist that may also change what you thought you knew about the ancient art of storytelling., Most admirably, Life of Pi resists turning its remarkably realistic, digitally created feline into a friend or pet., Theres an audience out there for this movie, but the question is whether they will find it., The movies energy peters out in a series of book-club conversations about divine will, the power of storytelling, and the resilience of the human spirit., A movie that cant be dismissed because there is too much in it but cant be embraced because its all spread too thin., This transcendent fable carries a real sting in its tail. Ang Lee has made a bold and wondrous movie, one of his best."
 Lincoln ,1,"Lincoln is a triumph., Its narrative swoop largely takes the legislative detail in its stride, plus the star is Daniel Day-Lewis, which is always a thing. He is not so much an actor, more a shape shifter., Its an intricate, thought- provoking and (be warned) very talkie study of democracy that is almost entirely schmaltz-free., Lincoln is an engrossing and even stirring civics lesson that tries, with admirable responsibility if only mixed success, to give voice to black America., Its very good, but thats not the point. Its necessary., Against the odds, Spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling., Spielberg is a man on a mission. And his not so secret weapon is Day-Lewis, an actor so charismatic its hard to think clearly while hes on screen., By stepping into history without fear, favour or any overfamiliar biopic folly, Lincoln, handsome, often thrilling, and movingly human, goes into history as a major movie achievement., A rousing, rigorous and morally complex legal procedural more than a trad biopic. And all the better for it., What a feat from Day-Lewis: the nearest thing a 21st-century biopic can get to a seance., Its tiresome to describe Day-Lewis as brilliant, so lets push the boat out: his Lincoln is absolutely wonderful., Lincoln works as a snapshot of a great man without ever slipping into a portrait of sainthood., As unexpected as it is intelligent, thanks to virtuoso work from Spielberg and Kushner, Lincoln is landmark filmmaking, while Day-Lewis is so authentic he pulls off that stovepipe., This is movie magic -- history coming to life, before our eyes., Its the most remarkable movie Steven Spielberg has made in quite a spell, and one of the things that makes it remarkable is how it fulfills those expectations by simultaneously ignoring and transcending them., Lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon. We dont need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was - this window is more than sufficient., Lincoln offers proof of what magic can happen when an actor falls in love with his character. Because as great as Day-Lewis has been in his many parts, he has never seemed quite so smitten., Day-Lewis convincingly comprehends Lincolns melancholy and his humor; his self-deprecation and brandishing of authority; his backwoods simplicity and his highly literate verbal dexterity…, Master shape-shifter Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a monumental portrayal of a man so firmly monumented in our nations history., The film masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life: how to bring the war between the states to an end, and how to eradicate slavery, once and for all."
 Silver Linings Playbook ,1,"Frustrating as it can be to watch, nixing nuance for a heavy-handed storyline that convinces viewers of Pat and Tiffanys humanity is forgivable., Russells smart, snappy script is delivered by a top-notch cast, including two thoroughly likeable and well-matched leads., But Silver Linings Playbook never induces a roll of the eyes, even if it never really surprises., Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks., Director David O. Russell, who adapted the novel, and his cast fill the story with engaging, believable characters., Its a rom-com that succeeds in revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed, injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped-up whimsy or social satire or montages of people walking on the beach., Unique, beguiling, and occasionally frustrating: These descriptions equally apply to Silver Linings Playbook and its two central characters., A crazy beaut of a comedy that brims with generosity and manages to circumvent predictability at every turn., Offers the satisfaction youd expect from a romcom and feel-good sports movie, but Lawrence and Coopers delicate treatment of their characters makes it far more than a fleeting source of entertainment., Silver Linings Playbook remains a very classy, acceptably funny slice of comic drama. But that eventual cop-out feels deeply unsatisfactory., This is a date movie that caters to the needs of both men and women: American football and comedy, ballroom dancing and romance. Silver Linings Playbook covers all those bases -- and rises above them too., Seeing it a second time has made me love it even more, not always the case., Silver Linings Playbook is all things to all moviegoers. Please join the queues circling the blocks., Might at first look like proper cinema red in tooth and claw, but underneath its a bundle of matted fleece and bleating., This is a date movie that doesnt offer the sophistication it thinks it does, but is as enjoyable and good-natured as the genre requires., An edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times., This meaningful film keeps the laughs, giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story., Lawrence, in her most high-low, sad-comic turn yet, is remarkable., It shouldnt work - theres just too much going on. But it does. Spectacularly. Go see it., Just about everybody in the cast of David O. Russells strange and disturbing and deeply romantic new film has the chance to act with a capital A."
 Zero Dark Thirty ,1,"Zero Dark Thirty is one of the great cinematic procedurals ever made., When it comes to establishing and maintaining tension, there wasnt a better American genre picture released this year. Refrain from viewing it as historical record and you wont leave disappointed., ... it is Chastains performance, as restrained as it is powerful, that may just be the cherry atop this massive and meticulous film., This doesnt zip along in the manner of typical Hollywood entertainment but its memorable cinema with a finale that will stay with you long after viewing., A great American film: complicated, nuanced, searching, piercing, difficult - and yet thrilling and satisfying all the same., Zero Dark Thirty is a magnificent movie, if we ignore the moral ambiguities. But can we?, If you like World War II films, youll enjoy this., Whats striking is the absence of triumphalism -- Bigelow doesnt shy away from showing the victims shot down in cold blood in the compound -- and we come away with the overwhelming sense that this has been a grim, dark episode in our history., So overwhelming is the momentum that it proves possible to live with the intelligence that the protagonist is complicit in ground-level fascism., Terrifically good, propulsive film-making ..., We get all imaginable views of the witchy pentacle that is covert US military politics., It haunts and lingers long after the lights go up., Its an effective thriller - uninterested in anyone other than the home team., In Kathryn Bigelows masterful thriller, the manhunt for Osama bin Laden is the ultimate no-win scenario: a battle neither side can afford to lose with a prize that may not be worth the fight., Gripping throughout, with an impressive central performance, this is like a Dogme 95 redo of a Chuck Norris film ..., This is an instant classic., Chastain makes Maya as vivid as a bloodshot eye. Her porcelain skin, delicate features and feminine attire belie the steel within., There is admirably little fat on its bones. No love interests, no backstories, no B-plot about Mayas childhood: Zero Dark Thirty is as ruthlessly, relentlessly single-minded as she is about the hunt for bin Laden., No doubt Zero Dark Thirty serves a function by airing Americas dirty laundry about detainee and torture programs, but in its wake, theres a crying need for a compassionate Coming Home to counter its brutal Deer Hunter., While Zero Dark Thirty may offer political and moral arguing points aplenty, as well as vicarious thrills,as a film it\s simply too much of a passable thing."
 12 Years a Slave ,2,"Director McQueen, drawing on the visual aesthetic of his previous works Shame and Hunger, never shies away from frames that capture the ways that beauty exists in the most painful situations., 12 Years a Slave is, like The Trial, a trapdoor over the abyss. Although less abrupt than Kafkas novel, the movie wastes little time before plunging its viewer into a nightmare of dehumanization., Ambitious, honest and horrifying all at once, 12 Years a Slave may not be the easiest film to watch more than once, but it will stay with you forever once you see it., Add the visionary direction by Steve McQueen, the British Turner Prize-winning artist turned film-maker (Hunger, Shame) and you have an out-and-out stunner., A significant, necessary piece of work, one that stays with you long after you rise out of your theater seat., Movies can do a great many things - they can make us laugh, or incite our heroism, or frighten us, or make us cry. 12 Years a Slave makes us feel, deeply and urgently., It speaks to the courage and resilience of one man, the savagery of many, and the potential, for both good and for ill, in us all., McQueen depicts the horrific experiences of Solomon Northup, the free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, in utterly unflinching fashion. The films strength lies in its frankness and avoidance of either sentimentality or Quentin Tarantino-style irony., In its own saintly manner, its as exploitative as anything critics accused Django Unchained of being, minus Tarantinos eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor., The film tells an irresistibly powerful story, in a way that does not shirk the horror. It is unbearable to watch at times, but that is as it should be., You will recoil. You will flinch. You will say to yourself, Oh no, not again. But the story will seize you with such a visceral power you will be rooted to the spot. I know I was and Im not easy to root., A film that, despite its surface simplicity, proves to be riven with contradictions to the point of incoherence., Ejiofor proves himself a master of physical understatement, the clench of his teeth and slightest parting of the lips speaking volumes., A tale of suffering, endurance, courage and abiding humanity about a freeborn man kidnapped and sold into slavery, which packs all the more wallop for the elegance with which its made., Ejiofor projects extraordinary integrity, even nobility - and he holds the camera magnificently. Its a deeply inward, deeply felt performance, surely a cert for one of the many Oscars this film must win., The American South\s peculiar institution has, it seems, become a fit topic for narrative cinema. And it only took a century., 12 Years a Slave proves McQueens formal prowess and, more significantly, his utter seriousness as a dramatist., 12 Years a Slave isnt simply a masterpiece, its a milestone. This, at last, really is history written with lightning., Twelve Years a Slave is a magnificent achievement and it is a career best for everyone involved, not least its artist-turned-director, Steve McQueen., The whole film breathes with reality, even while the bayou landscapes are infernalised, surrealised, by a terrible beauty of vision."
 American Hustle ,1,"Its enjoyable and fun to watch, but just barely touches the surface of its own narrative., Its a sly film that slips through your fingers, leaving the glitter of great performances, but one youll be hustling to watch again., A movie as smart as American Hustle knows that those tactile pleasures only matter if theyre attached to some kind of emotional resonance., Pure, raw energy., Few are the films that can be described as profoundly artistic and deliriously entertaining, substantial and soufflé-like. Noble, and screwy., The movies greatest strength is Russells magnanimity toward his characters, an equable, never cloying embrace of their imperfections., Like the Abscam con, the film is a convincing confection, so well played that we dont care if its the real deal or not., One of the films of the year for me., Save your admiration for the performances, especially Lawrence, who is now Hollywoods most important presence in front of the camera., It turns out that comb-overs, cleavage, cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo., Fun, charming, but slight - and way too long and flabby in the girth for such slightness., American Hustle doesnt conform to one genre, though it has elements of farce, screwball, heist thriller and caper comedy. In dressing it up like a Scorsese-style crime movie, Russell brings an unusual weight and tension to the film., Though never boring, American Hustle does itself feel a little like a con - a skilled exercise in creative misdirection., You forget that Russell once made such impenetrable navel-gazing twaddle as I Heart Huckabees, and simply revel in the fact that American Hustle is often deliriously good fun., Director David O. Russell and co-writer Eric Warren Singer grab hold of the FBIs long-time Abscam sting (conducted in the late 70s into 1980) as their kernel of truth, then Jiffy Pop it like mad., Ambitious even as it studies, exploits and explodes ambition, American Hustle is as good as any American film this year. It\s also a lot of fun. Don\t miss it., American Hustle is a movie built on that cornerstone of the American Dream, reinvention. If youre not happy with who you are, or who people think you are, then go ahead and become somebody else. Anything to survive - and thrive., So many layers of double-cross, lies, betrayal, grandiosity, and sheer insanity that the audience may feel they are getting lost, but in a way, that is the point., The source of this movies galvanizing intrigue is that the characters remain in play -- they never settle into place, Its one of the years cleverest films, and also one of the best."
 Captain Phillips ,1,"Hanks is the casting coup here, and anchors (forgive the pun) the film with the sense of a normal, modest everyman who is in over his head., The Navy SEALS procedural is a bit of a jumble even as it comfortingly demonstrates American competence in the face of a standoff. Still, its the captains passion that gives the movie its emotional intensity., My heart was in my mouth throughout. It is nail-bitingly exciting, even if you know the outcome, and I think I can safely say its a better film than the one I thought I was going to see., ... this high-stakes, visceral drama that allows the audience to experience the myriad emotions at the same time as the characters. It captures what is truly remarkable about the human spirit in times of peril., The films real muscle - intelligently never over-flexed - is as an allegory in the balance of global power and the value of life., It seems strange to say that an actor as awarded and acclaimed as Tom Hanks is still capable of surprising us. But he does in Captain Phillips, which is one of the best films of the year., Were carried along not just by the momentum of events, but by the precision with which theyre depicted., The disappointing aspect to Captain Phillips is that it doesnt go beyond action movie conventions., Over and over in this movie we hear variations on the phrase everything\s going to be OK. It\s just impossible to head out of the theater and back into the wider world believing that\s actually true., Were in the steady hands of Paul Greengrass, a director fully aware that convincing crisis stories involve conflicting interests and passions., While Captain Phillips, to its credit, honors the pirates with more back-story, and they evolve as characters ...the end still lands squarely in a Hollywood space., This is what piracy is now really like. In truth, it was probably always like this., There is still an authenticity to the performances that mannered writing cannot undo., For all its action aesthetics and nail-biting, gut-wrenching tension, this is on some level a film about globalisation, about what happens when the paths of the very poor and the very rich intersect in the crossfire of world economics., A ruthless, ripped-from-the-headlines seafaring thriller with a vintage turn from Tom Hanks., A film in which many exciting things happen on an actual working ship out in open water - and yet the movie is uncompelling., This is both Hankss and Greengrasss best and sturdiest work in a decade; a film that feels less written, acted and shot than smelted, fused and riveted., Mostly adapted from the Captains memoir Captain Phillips is conversely taut and slack; culturally savvy and naive; politically astute and manipulative; emotionally sincere and embarrassingly overwrought., The entire performance is one of the greatest in Hanks prolific, varied career - a role that gives him a massive arc and the opportunity to show great range., Director Paul Greengrass and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd create a vivid, insiders look at life at sea and how a crew of twenty did their best to elude their would-be captors."
 Dallas Buyers Club ,1,"The film fails to break the pattern of transphobic narratives in cinema, perhaps because it doesnt understand that trans people are not the same as cis gay people., Sometimes a character punches through the screen, beyond the film containing him. Matthew McConaugheys performance as an HIV-positive cowboy in Dallas Buyers Club is one of those moments., Though Jean-Marc Valles direction is sometimes indistinct, it does allow the actors to come off more inhibited in their performances and each scene is that much more authentic., Despite the cadaverous appearance of its lead actor, Dallas Buyers Club wants to be pretty, too, presenting a tidy, uplifting history of the years when unconscionable inaction and prejudice toward those with AIDS were a matter of federal policy., A powerfully moving film, and McConaugheys extraordinary physical transformation is much more than a stunt., What makes the film so special is its sense of defiance and its scabrous humour., McConaughey is so charismatic that, as a simple one-man-against-the-odds drama, Dallas Buyers Club is consistently engaging; almost, despite Woodroofs intentions, inspirational., McConaughey and Leto drill down to the roots of their characters. It calls to mind that advice for actors playing drunk: you do it like youre emphatically sober. Neither man plays the disease. They play instead the rage to live., Terrific performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto elevate this socio-medical drama out of the realms of the ordinary into something quietly remarkable., For all its occasional compromises, Dallas Buyers Club shakes off potential disease-of-the-month TV movie status and succeeds at an uncomplicated emotional level., Bravely, it offers neither a feel-good nor feel-bad payoff. However, the storys momentum fizzles out, its characters often feeling disconnected from each other and us., The performances are spectacular, McConaugheys especially, so alive in approaching death., It would be a TV problem-of-the-week movie without McConaugheys skill in combining intelligence with pizzazz., It is fantastic and Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his career. In fact, it may be the best performance of anyones career. Itll blow your tiny minds. It blew my tiny mind., A calculated prestige picture that never bothers to ask broader questions about the AIDS epidemic., Like a Gary Cooper in the era of sexual crisis, McConaughey hits a very sure stride., Get this - Matthew McConaughey is currently the most exciting acting talent at work in movies. Next up, the simple business of a Christopher Nolan., Matthew McConaugheys quest to establish himself as one of the finest, most committed actors of his generation continues apace in Jean-Marc Vallees fact-based Dallas Buyers Club., The AIDS epidemic was not a happy-ending story. But it was certainly a test of the human spirit. Ron Woodroof passed that test., Dallas Buyers Club is an indelible story about one mans unwillingness to go gently into that good night, and the personal growth he experiences along the way."
 Gravity ,1,"This is virtuoso film-making on every level., Their Sandra Bullock and George Clooney fight for survival against the odds is so brilliantly realised that you forgive the implausible plot. , With its themes of spirituality, religion, birth, rebirth and hope, Gravity is a film that will move audiences in different ways. Thats the beauty of it; it transcends genres, generations and time, a modern classic., A survival drama set almost entirely in the unfathomable abyss of outer space, Gravity is something now quite rare -- a truly popular big-budget Hollywood movie with a rich aesthetic pay-off., It is a big, bold picture that refuses to be timid, and it left me trembling. Its not just a film; its something that happens to you., So it was good, if a bit jarring, to feel myself shrink at the films beginning, when I found myself floating above the surface of the earth for a little while in absolute silence., The CGI is flawless, and the beautiful shot construction is staggering., This is a story about people floating through space, and Alfonso Cuaróns feature brilliantly contrives to make the viewer feel similarly untethered, to often thrilling effect. This is surely the closest cinema comes to three-dimensional virtual abseiling., Cuarons knack for long takes amplifies the terror, where devastation approaches without a sound and that thump you hear could very well be your own pulse., Its a technical marvel -- appropriately breathtaking in its evocation of spaces vastness and the buffeting suffered by the two astronauts in their efforts to anchor themselves to something solid. But Cuaron also knows how suspense works., An absolute technical marvel in every way possible -- from cinematography to special effects to sound design to score, all of Gravitys technical parts work together in perfect harmony for maximum effectiveness., Despite these flaws, Gravity is an amazing experience., Can one smell bull**** in space?, Created through a painstaking combination of physical and digital performance that disintegrates the divide between live action and animation, Gravity boasts a level of sheer visual invention that would have left Stanley Kubricks head spinning., One can easily imagine Robert Louis Stevenson or H Rider Haggard getting a kick out of Gravity., Its a bumpy trip, with two voyagers carrying, some will argue, excess charisma baggage. But its a trip no space spectacle fan should miss., Director and co-writer Cuarón brilliantly manages to create both awe at his glorious space vistas, and knuckle-gobbling tension at whats happening in the foreground., The film of the year., Believe the hype: Gravity is as jaw-droppingly spectacular as youve heard - magnificent from a technical perspective but also a marvel of controlled acting and precise tone., Gravity is a knock out, but without Bullock\s movie-star charisma and everywoman relatability, the film wouldn\t work nearly as well as it does."
 Nebraska ,1,"Nebraska is a slow-burning heart-warmer that neatly dodges the cornball bullet of a climactic manly hug., ... its beauty lies in its simplicity., Forever typecast as nutjobs and con artists, Derns Woody Grant is a little chubby, a little bewildered, and a lot unkempt. Hes grizzled, resigned, and wonderful, and so is the film., Nebraska, despite a few pleasures, strikes me as Paynes most cartoonish, one-dimensional work., There is a sentimental aspect to the concluding stages of the film: its not as broad or astringent as Payne can be. But theres also something intriguingly dreamlike about its tone., In Payne films, as in the films of Jean Renoir, there are no goodies or baddies; everyone has their reasons, and that makes his work distinctly different from most mainstream American films these days., An odyssey into the past, into missed opportunities, and into the complexities of an everyday family of malcontents., Payne has made an American Gothic for 21st-century, post-recession America. Who needs a pitchfork anyway, when you can have an ice cold bottle of Bud?, The deft achievement of this movie is that it has a hardness that doesnt delight in the meanness of mockery as the Coens often do., Nebraska tunes its bittersweet personal journey riffs to the plaintive waltz of picked guitars and lyrical fiddles, played out against a backdrop of fading midwest towns and long, lonesome interstates., Nebraska is an absolutely enchanting film, so funny, so touching, ringing true - for me right up there with the years best., Though taken from an original script by Bob Nelson, the result could hardly be more characteristic of Payne if his name were watermarked into every frame., In iconic black and white, the brilliant, empathetic Payne (Sideways) delivers another fully realized road movie - and Oscar contender., A bittersweet road movie about the joy and sadness of ageing directed by the great Alexander Payne., Think of David Lynchs The Straight Story and subtract colour and élan., An intimate road movie about one family that also lingers on the landscapes and fabric of an old-time, dying vision of the American Midwest, A charming road movie that develops into a full-blown study of life and roots, offering a beautiful insight into the way families migrate and change., Forte is a surprising fount of melancholy and frustrated ambition, while Dern takes a tough part -- a man of few words who might not be all there -- and masterfully controls his body to convey Woodys inner depths., Nebraska, it turns out, isn\t as bleak as it first looks., A desolate comedy-drama about fathers, sons, lifes highways and missed off-ramps."
 Philomena ,1,"It is quiet, restrained, unfussy, and has, at its heart, an injustice so grave it will make your blood boil. You will also cry., Despite its weighty themes, Stephen Frears film is almost as much a comedy as a drama., The movie is a bit of a puzzle coming from atheist co-writer Steve Coogan and the script grapples with these big questions of religion, class, and justice in a way thats far beyond the typical teary human-interest story., One of the best purely British films of the year., The final act is a great half hour or so of film -- funny, charming, sad, satisfying -- but the rest of Philomena isnt so up to snuff., What at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice -- first outrage, and with time, eventually, forgiveness., Its smart and unsweetened., Even as Philomena embraces the expected feel-good dynamics, it avoids taking the usual path and doesn\t paint all of the evil nuns with the same brush., Solving this mystery is not nearly as engrossing as watching the actors pas de deux., We wouldnt care about any of this if the performances were weak. But both actors find complexity and depth., At its core, this clever, wrenching, profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty., Director Steven Frears deserves special mention. A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy, sentimental junk. The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real. Its the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today., Dench is a delight, playing dowdy instead of her standard regal, and Coogan is appropriately droll and disillusioned. Together they manage to make a sad story feel somehow bright., A true story that takes unexpected, unusually poignant turns., The chemistry between Steve Coogan as a snooty journalist and Judi Dench as a retired nurse searching for her son brings humor and warmth to a harrowing tale of the plight of unwed Irish Catholic mothers in the 1950s., Go beyond the manner of its telling and you find a story of cruelty and evil, of shocking acts committed under a veneer of civility and sanctity., Philomena is a tearjerker of rare honesty and craft., An utterly charming combination of road trip, odd-couple comedy and heart-touching true story that will leave few dry-eyed, Philomena rests comfortably in the lap of the great Judi Dench., The story touches on some of the thorniest issues of Catholic doctrine and tempers its righteous anger with a tone more sad than bitter., Director Stephen Frears manages to successfully walk the tricky line between comedy and dark drama. It keeps the audience off-kilter a bit, but in a good way; we shouldnt always need to know whats coming next, in terms of tone or plot."
 The Wolf of Wall Street ,1,"... A sprawling riot of bad taste and consumption — and tremendously entertaining if you’re in the right mood. , The film has roused censure for glorifying crime, with scant, awkwardly realised minutes paid to Belforts eventual comeuppance. But surely 71-year-old Scorsese, a one-time wannabe priest whose work is preoccupied with morality, did that deliberately?, Scorsese is fascinated by procedure, by drawing back the curtain and showing us how things happen, though he keeps the picture nimble and entertaining enough to avoid burying himself in the minutiae., Belfort is in the wrong. Thats for sure. But to walk away and not realize were at least a little complicit, too, would be foolhardy., DiCaprios powerhouse performance, and Scorseses brilliantly energetic direction make this a must watch for film lovers., Scorseses hard-R portrayal of Belfort and companys insatiable appetites -- for money, for whores, for drugs, for stuff -- pierces until it numbs., Along with its three-hour runtime, this baggy plotting may make Wolf a somewhat harder sell to audiences but its a deeper movie than The Departed -- among the best that Scorsese has made., There is no psychological insight, no moral insight, just no insight, full stop. And it palls after a while., Movies shouldnt provide moral instruction but the best incorporate competing philosophies. Unfortunately, there is no one Scorsese can bring himself to be quite as interested in as Belfort., It made me not love but utterly loathe Belfort - a moral victory, perhaps, but also something of a problem, because a character who is simply detestable rapidly becomes uninteresting., At times, the film seems almost Hobbitian in its inability to finish a scene that is already well past its natural lifespan., Is it immoral to celebrate villainy? Theres not much point in pretending The Wolf of Wall Street doesnt do that, pretty exuberantly too., Every time I looked at my watch, the hands seemed to have stayed still., The Wolf of Wall Street does not quite have the subtlety and richness of Scorseses very best work, but what an incredibly exhilarating film: a deafening and sustained howl of depravity., DiCaprio has hinted before that comedy might be his natural calling -- think of Catch Me If You Can -- but his energy here is not just fun, its discovery., For three hours the movie operates at a ridiculous comedic pitch. You never forget youre at the circus. You never lose site of the lawlessness, the reckless pleasure, the sheer lunacy and lack of regulation., Without a moral center, Wolf seems to revel in this cornucopia of bad behavior., It lets you relish in unparalleled no holds barred debauchery while increasingly disillusioning the fun and games with the nasty reality of the situation along the way., Scorsese unleashes a furious, yet exquisitely controlled, kinetic energy, complete with a plunging and soaring camera, mercurial and conspicuous special effects, counterfactual scenes, subjective fantasies, and swirling choreography on a grand scale., The Wolf of Wall Street is a magnificent black comedy: fast, funny, and remarkably filthy."
 Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) ,2,"Its not perfect (it can be exhausting at times, actually), but it says a lot about people, narcissism and the co-dependent relationship between actor and celebrity., A thunderbolt reminder of the kind of quick-thinking, quick-talking, quick-witted characters that Keaton used to specialize in, and Iñárritu finds the right style to showcase his gifts., Even when Keaton is transforming his characters stock issues into ones that feel unique and genuine, hes undercut by his directors flashiness, right up to an on-the-nose finale., Birdman is a one-trick pony of a movie, but what a trick. The technical achievement alone is immense., You are unlikely to see a better American film this year., Birdman has wings, for certain, even if you find the feathers sticking in your throat now and then., Birdman, more than most, seems a film that deserves a second viewing, not only to admire the work of Keaton and his co-stars, but to delve into its many layers., Its a quasi-religious fable about a man haunted by the past and facing a profound moral and existential crisis in the present, and its a dazzling display of virtuoso cinematic technique and showboat performances., It is a work of magical realism, or perhaps moderate insanity. And it will take your breath away., This thing flies, and even if its audience is reduced to looking up and pointing skyward, thats a pleasure in itself., You cant help liking the mind or minds that thought the film up; you wouldnt want to close it; and you can bet money on seeing Michael Keaton, here in blisteringly inventive form, in the Best Actor suspects line-up on Oscar night., The characters in Birdman dont always find redemption, but Iñárritus faith in people has never felt more real., This is a strange and beautiful and unique film, one of the best movies of the year., Birdman is audacious technically, and so meta it may well blow your mind, but it is also weird, maddening, wearing and exhausting., The reason this scalding industry satire works as well as it does is because it has a grounding in some fairly uncomfortable truths about the movie business even as the plot indulges in flights -- literally -- of fancy., Its a pleasing irony that this study of one actors search for honesty has been concocted using a repertoire of visual sleights of hand. A philosophical rumination it may be but that doesnt prevent it from also being an adrenalised delight., Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is the sort of movie that ends up on a persons favourite-movies-of-all-time list. Its really that fresh., For all this admirably odd films virtues, its pretensions do let it down at times., Birdman is everything you want movies to be: vital, challenging, intellectually alive, visually stunning, emotionally affecting., Billy Wilder once said: If you\re going to tell people the truth, be funny or they\ll kill you. I\m guessing Mexican writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu would agree."
 American Sniper ,1,"The script and direction are unabashedly skewed towards feeding a lowest-common-denominator notion of war heroes and takes a righteous stand in favour of war, rather than exploring or portraying an authentic picture of the psychological impact..., For many, I suspect, American Sniper may be weirdly liberating-gratifying a perhaps hitherto unsuspected desire to see their pessimism, hopeless and unchanging, projected on the screen., Well-produced but flawed., Not only watchable, but quite good - the kind of lean, mean mediation on masculinity and duty that this particular filmmaker has always done so well., American Sniper cannot be reduced to simple pro- or anti-war labels., American Sniper has a perspective thats recognizable from the classic Westerns Eastwood has long been associated with, both as an actor and a director. Its an existential critique of violent machismo that doubles as a celebration of violence., Eastwood makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent., Clint Eastwoods American Sniper is an often lazy and somewhat hazy propaganda film about American heroism and hell in the Iraq War., Although Cooper succeeds in resembling and sounding like the real Kyle, this isnt some cheap impersonation trick. Cooper gives maybe the best performance of his career., Unlike the movie version of Chris Kyle who never makes a mistake, Eastwood and his writer are prone to flubs that cost them their fog of war stance., Cooper looks the part, having bulked up for it, but he cant do anything with the blandness of the character the script has given him., Weve seen it before, but Eastwood is good at making it seem raw and personal, largely by the care he takes in building a character, and the situations that will test them., Director Clint Eastwood deftly shows the mental and physical toll of heroism in a way that will leave you gutted., Eastwood has stripped things back so that we observe the action through American eyes only, our focus as blinkered as that of its titular killer., The 84-year-olds deep appreciation of the masculine -- its conflicts, its appeal, its evolving truths -- has added texture to our understanding of violence, warfare and more. At least as it is represented onscreen., Director Clint Eastwood continues his quiet critique of the moviegoers deep delight in cinematic violence., It may be admirable for Eastwood to have de-dramatised the material. But that doesnt make this hugely disappointing film any easier to sit through., American Sniper romanticizes Kyle, whose bestselling memoir, which put him on talk-show appearances, included boastful stories of dubious authenticity. What remains is distilled and dramatized, a story of loss, the story of the universal soldier., The fluidity and tension of the battle scenes is breathtaking, Eastwood at his cinematic best. But its the ever-tightening knot inside of Kyle the director really wants to understand., If American Sniper fails at being a truly great film, it is no fault of its star."
 Boyhood ,1,"...it’s hyperbolic in its minimalism and boring in spots and its overall narrative reach often exceeds its grasp. Even still, it’s one of the most important movies of the decade so far and you should experience it just to say you did., Like Michael Apted in his Seven Up! documentary series, Linklater makes you feel as if youre watching a photograph as it develops in the darkroom., An audacious effort from a filmmaker whose ability to embed the audience in his stories is unmatched., Calling it a sum of its parts can be a backhanded compliment, but it feels like especially worthy praise for Boyhood, considering how much went into making it feel whole., Boyhood reveals itself as something deeper, more noteworthy and ambitious than even its remarkable production would suggest, for Linklater has given us nothing less than a cinematic approximation of human memory., We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous., While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane., Its like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness., As is Linklaters custom, Boyhood is profound in such a casual way that its weighty themes feel nonchalant, effortless. This movie might make you cry for reasons you cant quite articulate. You wont be alone in feeling that way., Cinema has always been the best place for time travel, but rarely has it been so anchored in reality than in Richard Linklaters Boyhood., Linklater bridges the gap between these more art-oriented projects and contemporary narrative cinema. He offers us a new sense of knowing time by inviting us to be present as it unfurls., One of the loveliest things about Boyhood is how much of it makes those long-forgotten strings of childhood vibrate within you. It reminds you of what it was like to be a kid., A word about the films epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching., Linklaters casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce., Richard Linklaters Boyhood is in most respects a traditional realist film -- plainly shot, devoid of plot gimmicks, aiming to approximate life as it is actually lived., Watching the film, I wasnt exactly as moved as Id hoped I would be, and that was at first disappointing. But then I remembered that Richard Linklater doesnt really do big emotional indicating, that you have to listen a little closer., Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life., It\s the casual ease of Boyhood\s construction, its lack of a specifically lofty artistic objective, that makes it so effective., Boyhood is as immersive as it is observational, and at the same time inescapably self-reflective. In terms of manipulating the relationship between viewer and screen, there is nothing quite like it., This is an intimate, poignant film that makes you feel a little sad. But there are lots of loving and funny moments - such as when Mason and his kids campaign for Barack Obama - and the overall effect is life-affirming."
 The Grand Budapest Hotel ,1,"Wes Anderson blends his trademark fanciness with a more rompish style of humour than usual., Times have changed. It\s an elemental Wes Anderson lament..., Discerning travellers and Wes Anderson fans will luxuriate in the glorious Mittel-European kitsch of one of the directors funniest and most exquisitely designed movies in years., Just plain fun, full of the filmmakers signature flourishes and curlicues, worked out with skill and finesse., The Grand Budapest Hotel is not his grandest work yet, but it is one worth an extended stay., The mannered, madcap proceedings are often delightful, occasionally silly, and here and there, gruesome and/or heartbreaking., This is a visually stunning film, but above all its a hugely enjoyable one., Grand isnt good enough a word for this Budapest Hotel. Great is more like it., Anderson\s films are too precious for some, but for those of us willing to lose ourselves in them, they\re a delight. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different, except that he has added a hint of gravitas to the mix, improving the recipe., For his fans this tribute to a bygone era and in fact a bygone world is a brilliant watch, one of the most thoughtful of Andersons films even amongst the grandiose escapism., Andersons film looks good enough to eat; swallowing it is another matter., It is a film that maintains its illusion with grace-and ruefully unmasks that illusion every bit as gracefully., It is beautifully designed, visually ravishing and symmetrical to the nth degree. And it is full of frantic chaos, with a Lord of Misrule at its centre played with effortless comic brilliance by Ralph Fiennes., The result is a deliciously rich and, dare I say, old-fashioned entertainment, filled with affectionate jokes and cinematic references., The movie is a flume ride through the imagination of one of the most creative minds making movies today, and the pleasure curls your toes. Also, be ready to crave some macaroons., Budapest is pretty much an old-fashioned screwball comedy garishly dressed. It\s goofy, eccentric and often downright silly. There are many scenes that would have worked in a Three Stooges movie., After feeding on this sweet buffet, sated cinephiles will want to call the front desk to extend their stay., In its own silly, artificial way, its the first Anderson film to acknowledge the existence of a world outside its own little toy box and to ground its characters nostalgia in something resembling actual historical reality., All the cutesiness in the world cant really make what was beginning to happen in 1930s Europe remotely charming, as Anderson seems to want to do., The comedy in The Grand Budapest Hotel is among the broadest yet undertaken by Anderson. But amid the frenzied hubbub, there are intimations of a darker, sadder history unfolding."
 The Imitation Game ,1,"Cumberbatch helps elevate what couldve been a rote boilerplate biopic into a film with the spark of a live wire., A moving tribute to an extraordinary man., What could have been a very dry and earnest film emerges, under the intelligent direction of Norwegian Morten Tyldum working from a screenplay by Graham Moore, as a gripping and still rather extraordinary story., The action here is Turing tinkering with his machine. Or simply thinking -- which, as Cumberbatch portrays it, is adventure of the highest order., We go into a movie knowing that the subject was as genius or a hero, a martyr or titan. We should leave with a more nuanced understanding of who he was, his complexities and flaws., For the filmmakers, there are simplifications that must have been inevitable, for dramatic and narrative purposes, when it comes to depicting the years of wartime work. But what of the other choices that have been made?, Benedict Cumberbatch has had a meteoric rise, and for good reason -- hes really good at what he does. Here, he does a lot with a little., Cumberbatch is the main event here, making something almost impossible (capturing such a man as Turing in a tidy two-hour package) look easy, important, and appropriately imperfect., Its mostly to Cumberbatchs credit that The Imitation Game plays like a solid, engaging historical drama, interesting enough to suit audiences that arent interested in either World War II history or technology., This film about one of the past centurys smartest humans at times treats its own audience like a classroom of remedial learners., Its a film about drive, about imagination, and how brilliance thrives outside the mainstream. These are common enough themes given uncommon purchase in a film about a man who likely saved millions of lives by never fitting in., Cumberbatchs whose portrayal of the British mathematician and WWII code-smasher is a feat of nuanced intelligence, a portrait of anguish with hints of arid humor. And, yes, arrogance., Produced with a Masterpiece Theater eye for period detail, but also with a missionarys zeal to honor a wrongly dishonored man., Cumberbatch is moviedoms man of the moment, and with this painfully human performance, the actor who has specialized in difficult geniuses finally cracks the code of compassion., This films overall success hangs on Cumberbatch and what is, to date, his finest performance on the big screen., It would be hard to foul up the story of Alan Turing, and thankfully The Imitation Game doesnt., Turing may finally be getting what he deserves as the straightforward and well-acted The Imitation Game, featuring a strong performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing., The Imitation Game is both an education and a pleasure - and another chance to revel in what Cumberbatch can convey in eloquent silence., Unlike The Kings Speech, which won a clutch of Oscars for its dull propriety and Masterpiece Theater vibe, The Imitation Game is vibrant and lively, engaging you on several levels., Cumberbatchs finely calibrated performance helps bring to life one of historys lesser-known stories and most shameful injustices."
 Selma ,1,"One of the most effective, well-crafted historical biopics that Ive ever seen... giving us a moment in history that feels immediately familiar to the moment we are currently living in., Excellent acting, very good directing, a good tight script -- a little bit of pacing issues and... other characters are nowhere near as investing as Martin Luther King is., If you dont mind the technical confusion its a gripping story, and a great credit to DuVernay and co-writer Paul Webb who were unable to use Kings original speeches for copyright reasons., Ava DuVernays Selma is a beautifully observed drama of public and private lives, of personal narratives and historic moments., Selma is an always-gripping, often-bruising film, with fantastic performances and a solidly written script that contextualizes Kings work in an effectively impactful way., I this movie has some of the most powerful moments Ive seen I think all year., Selma is an important movie, yes, but it is also a great one., There are no wasted moments here. There are no wasted characters. The film is as much about Martin Luther King Jr. as it is about the people he worked with, and fought for., It is a very, very good movie, beautifully shot by Bradford Young and deftly, almost astonishingly well-directed by relative newcomer Ava DuVernay., David Oyelowo breathes such life into it and makes you feel like youre seeing this person for the first time., Its extremely difficult to portray a legendary historical figure in a way that does justice to both that figures momentousness and his humanity, but Oyelowo has found a way to do it., Even if DuVernay stumbles a bit when it comes to political sausage-making (really, who knows?), the film is dramatically tight and emotionally true., So, is Selma the film I wanted? No. Is is a good film? Yes, but its not great., A monumental achievement., The timeliness of the picture, coupled with the immediacy of the filmmaking, renders Selma more powerful than even its skilled creators couldve possibly intended., Selma isnt a discrete story of one moment in time that we can observe safely from the sidelines. It is all around us, every day., In compact, economical form, DuVernay sets out her table: the juxtaposition of domestic intimacy and institutional violence; the tension between the personal and political; the vivid interplay between the historical and the contemporary., In some ways its beyond criticism as the first-ever major movie about this heroic campaigner., The famed American civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr has been strangely under-represented in the cinema. Ava DuVernays excellent third film thankfully puts this continued omission right., Selma is a rousing political drama, made with enough verve and passion never merely to seem didactic. Its near complete absence from this years Oscar nominations is baffling and suggests a double standard."
 The Theory of Everything ,1,"This wonderfully slippery Hitchcockian sci-fi is an elegant puzzle box full of ingenious ideas.\n\n, An overlong but enjoyable metaphysical thriller that delivers pastiche so meticulous it becomes its own source of supremely cinematic pleasure., It may overstay its welcome, leaving behind the sense of a highly talented visualist in search of a richer emotional canvas, but this discovery will be relished by connoisseurs of post-War paranoia and independent-minded distribution outlets alike."
 Whiplash ,1,"The film has potential, but ultimately theres more bark than bite., Revealing both the dangers and payoffs of artistic ambition, Whiplash is sure to establish Chazelle as a directorial force to be reckoned with., Its a thorny, thoughtful movie that asks provocative questions and isnt cocky enough to boast of knowing the answers., For all its overripe contrivance, youll leave the cinema with a spring in your step and a thump in your chest, eager to bang the drum for what deserves to be one of the years real word-of-mouth hits., Chazelle, training a keen eye on the proceedings, seems to delight in the spectacle of relentless punishment., What gives the film such a kick, in spite of its improbabilities, is its raw and brutal but also very subtle portrayal of the shifting, attritional relations between teacher and student, sorcerer and apprentice., I suggest you take a defibrillator to Whiplash, since the chances of a heart attack or spontaneous combustion during viewing are high., Whiplash moves at a whipcrack pace that takes its rhythmic cues from drumming (some of the cuts are as fast as the beats in a Buddy Rich solo)., Few relationships in recent cinema have been quite so compelling. Bring a welders mask to ward off sparks., Whiplash is an extraordinarily taut, accomplished piece of work for a debut feature. Its also unusual in having such a definite point to make - albeit perhaps a pretty objectionable one., The film offers dark, ripsnorting fun if not, necessarily, an accurate portrait of life and times at premium music colleges., If Facebooks Marc Zuckerberg took jazz drumming lessons from Dr Hannibal Lecter, the result might look like this., Its the work of an accomplished talent., I push people beyond what\s expected of them, Simmons tells Teller. I believe that\s an absolute necessity. You might say the same about the film., If Chazelles primary objective was simply to present two grossly exaggerated and unsympathetic characters, then hes succeeded in some style., The movie swings - physically, musically, psychologically, racially., It would be an insult to call Chazelle a promising filmmaker, as this movie doesn\t indicate mere potential - it is evidence of authentic, sometimes blazing talent., Such a cooked-up piece of claptrap that I half expected Darth Vader to pick up the baton., Whiplash is electric from beginning to end, a musical story of obsession, frustration and outright cruelty built on two knockout performances., Director Damien Chazelle, who based the story on his own experience as a student jazz drummer in the thrall of an Alpha task-master, has created a remarkably economical and claustrophobic piece of storytelling."
 Bridge of Spies ,1,"There are no directing bells and whistles here, just a grown-up story expertly told. , Director Steven Spielberg gives audiences a meticulously composed espionage thriller, which establishes a tense atmosphere from the start and keeps the viewer engaged throughout. Full review in Japanese, This is a filmmaker with a lifetime of skill and experience, crafting his vintage pictures with style and grace, and were all better off for it., Bridge of Spies is a quality film featuring loads of commendable work, but Spielbergs glossy and exceedingly upbeat take on the material might make it more of a crowdpleaser than an Oscar contender., Bridge of Spies is a warm portrait of a friendship, an excitingly intricate story of realistically scaled suspense, and a visually ravishing and lovingly crafted rendering of mid-century America, where how you look matters much less than what you do., The genius of the casting is in the contrast: Hanks, the richly sympathetic screen actor, and Rylance, no less colossal a talent but one comparatively untried in cinema., A solidly entertaining Cold War thriller., An elegant, intelligent slice of popular entertainment that peppers its gripping intrigue with winning wit and humour., Bridge of Spies has some hold-ups and blockages. But in the best scenes the traffic flows fluently over the purling, perilous currents of cold war history., As a Cold War film, its strong. As a window into Spielbergs mind, its essential., So godlike is Spielbergs status that we often take his talents for granted. The strange, riveting mix of Bridge Of Spies is another sterling reminder that we shouldnt., Bridge of Spies is a heart-on-its-sleeve affirmation of American values -- not in the loaded contemporary sense of the term, but in the way the country was founded on values we have to work and fight to abide by., Authentic re-creations of the period, including duck-and-cover clips about a nuclear holocaust that frightened young students, serve as a reminder of a time, not unlike our own, when the threat of terror kept a steady and disturbing beat., Spielberg and Charman frame Donovan as a thin bulwark against the American governments attempts to work around its own supposed ideals at the height of the Cold War., Bridge of Spies connects Cold War paranoia to todays terror. Thats a bridge worth building., Bridge of Spies is one of the most dexterous and pleasurable films of the year; a fine example of Spielbergs unique late style, which shows a grasp of viewer psychology any marketing guru might envy., When all the international parties finally meet up at the shadowy titular bridge, we get to witness humanity - and classic filmmaking - at its finest., When a film is as enjoyable as this one, its timing so sweet, and its atmosphere conjured with such skill, do you really wish to register a complaint? Would it help?, Spielberg, never quit making movies, you continue to remind me why I love them., In Bridge Of Spies, Steven Spielberg finds the perfect use for Tom Hanks squinty dignity."
 Brooklyn ,1,"Brooklyn arrives duly hyped, and disappoints just as reliably., Brooklyn is one of the best films ever made about leaving ones homeland in search of a better life, and forging a new path. Full review in Japanese, Brooklyn is marvelous, watching it as close to pure bliss as any cinematic confectionary treat as I could possibly have imagined myself., Brooklyn is the very essence of a simple story, beautifully told., Brooklyn might sound like some sort of starchy period piece, which couldnt be further from the truth - its vibrant and warm and funny., Part of the films charm is the way that Irish director John Crowley manages the mood, without compromising the momentum. His direction is impeccable., Ronans accomplished performance provides the heart of the film, and, despite the mistakes she makes, the viewer comes to care deeply for this young woman and hope for a happy outcome to her dilemmas., Brooklyn at heart is a womens picture, that staple of mid-century cinema in which a woman must choose her path in life, and the film adapts the genres traditions splendidly., I could have hung out with everyone in Brooklyn for hours: Its a world you wont want to leave., With compassion, a touch of melancholy and a sense of wonder, Brooklyn reveals the profound truths in a simple, familiar story, ending on a note thats achingly bittersweet, no matter where youre from., Its a witty, dreamy love letter to independence and self-discovery - no matter where you call home., Although not without moments of sadness and tragedy, Brooklyn is sublimely uplifting and life affirming., Fans of the novel, of which Im one, may find the film sweeter and more romantic than Toibins original conception., Ronan, in every scene of the film, creates a reserved young woman who seems to mature before our eyes, quietly revealing Eilis open, yearning heart., Brooklyn is a simple story affectingly told, bridging the emotional gulf one feels when ambition and home are an ocean apart and love is uncertain in either place., Brooklyn is that rare period drama that doesnt lose itself in its dogged re-creation of another time., Its such a beautiful film., Big, romantic and as sweet as wedding cake, Brooklyn is a bi-continental love story that proudly wears its heart on its well-crafted sleeve., If youre yearning to take a sentimental journey, Brooklyn is the perfect destination., If you think they don\t make movies like they used to, Brooklyn is glorious proof to the contrary."
 Mad Max: Fury Road ,1,"In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters?... Also how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?!, Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster., Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums., Holy cow I loved this movie., I had my palm raised to the universe the second Charlize Therons Furiosa took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert., Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie with the kind of reach most people - and even most movies - can only aspire to., The memories of the original Mad Max series are intact. This is not more of the same. Fury Road takes you down a different trail., Yeah, I get it. I admired the film a lot. But did I love it? Well..., A machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours., George Millers Mad Max: Fury Road upends all expectations-about how action sequences are composed, what themes a blockbuster can contain, or who a films actual protagonist can be-and puts most other filmmakers working on this scale to shame., Its hard to do justice in words to Fury Roads nonstop, breathtaking action sequences., Theres an amazing sense of scale and depth to the cinematography by John Seale, who came out of retirement for this one, and also a brilliantly varied color palette., Fury Road, despite its lack of an interesting plot, despite the absence of flesh-and-blood characters, despite the basic sameness of any sequel, still manages to thrill., Happy end of the world., For all its action and spectacle, Mad Max: Fury Road represents a sort of creative idealism that critics and cinephiles swoon for., Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. Theres no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance., Even after two viewings, I feel as though Ive only scratched the surface of Mad Max: Fury Road. George Millers action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them., To think that this furious, fuming, freaky world should have been created by a man in his 70s, the same guy who warmed the cockles of our heart with Happy Feet and Babe, is unbelievable., Fury Road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee-led blockbusters which are built on CGI and designed to sell toys., An orgy of loud and louder, leaving us alternately exhilarated, exasperated and exhausted."
 The Martian ,1,"The Martian is a film about human error, the will to survive, and the responsibility that we have as human beings, not just to the work that we dedicate our lives to, but to one another as people., A half-hour into The Martian any seasoned moviegoer can figure out where the plotline in this feel-good movie has to go. Thats a shame and the films biggest transgression., Despite being marketed under the mainstream bait of a space movie, The Martian is, more than anything, a love letter to science, without ever feeling like a boring textbook., I have no idea if the science in The Martian is accurate. It sure felt accurate, which is all that matters in a way. On top of being wildly entertaining, the film is about using your wits to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds., Its just a cracklingly good entertainment, a crowd-pleaser thats compelling and emotional and even a little inspirational., Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift. Would any other actor have shouldered the weight of the role with such diligent grace?, If Damon manages to get into the awards fray for this role -- and he should -- it will be thanks to the fact that he makes it easy to understand how a desperate man could still find a way to laugh., Its pretty sunny and often funny, a space oddity for a director not known for pictures with a sense of humor., Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character\s solo ordeal -- at one point, scraggly Watney calls himself a space pirate -- Damon is the key to the movie\s exuberance., cotts directorial skills are such that for much of the film youre rooted to your seat as Damons Mark Watney struggles to survive., This is still a very nerdy movie, with lots of botany and physics and we ran the numbers and it checks out, but most of the book\s wonkiness is ironed out in favor of moving the story along more pleasingly for the science-allergic., The film is a profound testament to the rare-and underrated-virtue of simply not screwing anything up., The Martian delivers on both intergalactic spectacle and feet-in-the-soil character drama., After Body of Lies, Prometheus and Exodus: Gods and Kings, its good to see Ridley Scott get back some of his lost form in The Martian., We are so used to sci-fi movies in which the heroes shoot martians with ray guns that Scotts botanical approach cant help but seem offbeat and refreshing., The Martian plays to both Scotts strengths and weaknesses. By relegating Marks predicament to a purely survivalist scenario, he keeps things humming along without ever widening the horizon. But there was an obligation to widen the horizon., Its a brisk, funny piece of competence-porn sci-fi., Cynical as I am about how monster-budget blockbusters have come to dominate the studio mind-set, I cant imagine anyone not liking this one., This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience., Hell, Im scared of simply sleeping outdoors and I walked out of the movie with just the tiniest daydream of strapping myself into a rocket and shooting for the stars (ideally with Matt Damon as my co-pilot)."
 The Revenant ,1,"Gyllenhaal is good as the intense American sergeant..., Gyllenhaal s energy is perfect for the relatively sober-minded The Covenant — and allows space for Dar Salim to shine, in a more substantial lead than the majority of his Hollywood roles have afforded him so far. , Though the movie is fictional, the uncertain fate of thousands of real Afghan interpreters after the hurried 2021 US withdrawal gives it genuine heft., This feels like a breath of fresh air for Guy Ritchie. He is really reinvigorated by paring it down. , The perfect two person story. , This gripping look at war gets under your skin., The Covenant doesn’t arouse the stirrings of fervor that many war movies tap into but neither is it a nihilistic descent into the inhumanity of battle., Swinging back to a more serious register, Ritchie presents his first film grounded in harsh real-world politics, and it’s the best film he’s made in years., Jake Gyllenhaal stars in skillfully made and gripping film..., For much of its running time, director Ritchie’s war movie manages to be topical, suspenseful, and moving. But partly because the story is fiction, Ritchie takes a few genre liberties that threaten to undermine the sincerity of his tale., The Covenant does merit bonus points for showcasing Salim, a terrific journeyman actor who finally has a meaty role in an American movie. , A muscular, overwrought war film., A sober military thriller that excoriates Joe Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan in 2021 and, in the process, to strand the thousands of local interpreters who had risked their lives to aid the American cause., How does it honor these brave and essential people to make a movie that isn’t about any of them but rather a near-superhuman fictional character?, It’s good to see Ritchie branch out — just like after “Snatch” and “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” he made us all do a double-take with “Aladdin.” Not everything works in “The Covenant,” but he’s not lost in the desert, either.   , For all its clichés, this furious and discomfiting film tugs on your conscience for days, making a powerful case to turn the American public’s attention back to a conflict it would rather forget.\n, The Covenant works best when the two leads are forced to be silent lest they tip off prowling combatants. , An oftentimes riveting war film which marks a new path for the 54-year-old filmmaker., Gyllenhaal, who’s looking more and more like a trimmer Javier Bardem, uses that handsome-hangdog face of his to good effect. Salim, an Iraqi-born Danish actor, is very good. If he weren’t, the movie simply wouldn’t work., Instead of layering on jump cuts, crazy camera angles and jokey subtitles like he usually does, he keeps things calm. Ritchie lets the action unfold swiftly and clearly."
 Room ,1,"I remain struck by both the simplicity and tenderness of the narrative that is haunted by a deep tragedy., Room takes a nightmarish premise in an impossibly contained set and turns it into one of this years most emotionally poignant films., Room is a lithe, deeply moving wonder that builds to a miraculous coda., Room can be, at times, an almost unbearably emotional experience, but thats a good thing. It feels good to feel so much at the movies., This is a film that trusts its audience, and takes its time letting them in on the particulars of what these two are doing in this room., Theres no denying that Room starts from a dark place, but that does not necessarily make it a bleak film., Room is a powerful imagining of an extraordinary situation, but its also a poignant evocation of the ordinary, everyday intensity and complexity of the bond between mother and child., Larson delivers every line to perfection and, as it happens, theres not one weak link in the cast., Abrahamson has the intelligence to trust his cast to show us the world through their eyes. And oh, what a world it is., A soul-stirring feel-good weepie., Room offers highly imaginative and, at times, visionary film-making that transcends its claustrophobic settings and defies genre stereotyping., The films problem... lies in its efforts to convert the story into a metaphor for something larger., We are left with a film that manages a degree of optimism in the most unpromising circumstances. It is a substantial achievement., This is a disturbing and absorbing film, shrewdly acted, particularly by Larson. It lets the audience in; it does not just let the nightmare stun them into submission., Room ... is not a thriller, but a moving feminist tract which explores questions of what it means to be a mother, what it means to give love, and what it means to receive it., The film derives much of its power, during the times it is powerful, from its central performances., Its a story so abhorrent and seemingly hopeless that there may be times you dont want it to go on, but within its tight confines Lenny Abrahamson, with a script by Emma Donoghue, finds warmth and hope., Its hard to think of a movie adaptation of a book that feels truer and more loyal to its source than Room., Its a deeply satisfying, profoundly moving adaptation of a popular novel, an all-too-rare occurrence in modern Hollywood., Room is astonishing: It transmutes a lurid, true-crime situation into a fairy tale in which fairy tales are a source of survival."
 Arrival ,1,"Arrival transcends the limitations that so often govern the less creative examples of the subgenre, instead using it as a loose conceptual foundation upon which to build a theoretically-informed examination of what precisely ... makes us human., Arrival couldnt have arrived (pun intended) at a better time., I think of Arrival in terms of color: the milky grays of the clouds rolling over the Montana plain; the bright blue of computer screens bouncing off the gray tents on the makeshift army compound., Arrival isnt exactly your typical alien movie -- its so much better than that. This is a movie about how language actually influences the way you think and live your life., Everything about Arrival feels meticulously crafted, from the gorgeously composed shots to the Jóhann Jóhannsson score., A Spielberg-Nolan lovechild of sorts, wondrous and mind-bending in equal parts, Denis Villeneuves latest is a quintessential science-fiction blockbuster steeped in genre traditions and made singular by Amy Adamss transporting performance., Its a film youll want to discuss and debate with your friends. The message may not be original but the methodology certainly is. A movie doesnt have to spell everything out for me if I get a sense that the filmmaker is offering me something to ponder, In this year of bruising American politics, the films emphasis on measured communication and focused listening feels transformative., The revelation here is Villeneuve, who expands on the symphonic pacing showcased last year in the drug war drama Sicario. Even though the concept of Arrival is far-out fiction, Villeneuve treats it with no less detail or urgency., The best film of the year to date, ambitious in conception and extraordinary in execution, has arrived., Arrival may be just the poem we need; a departure from the dystopian visions which now appear all too real, a memory of a future in which light still shines in the darkness., The Chomsky-esque notions that language shapes our thinking even more than our thinking shapes language is conveyed in the films own structure as well as its dialog., Learning Heptapodese seems easy compared to the tough talks Americans need to have with each other., Arrival is one of the best movies of the year, a moving, gripping film with startling twists and imagery. It deserves serious treatment as a work of art., With Arrival, Villeneuve finally finds a subject, and a script, whose magnitude matches the weight he assigns to it. All it took was an alien species appearance on Earth., Those expecting a whiz-bang film should be prepared for a more cerebral and emotional experience, admirable for its ambition and tone, if not wholly satisfying in its payoff., Arrival plays with your head as gently as any sci-fi thriller I can remember., Arrival has the look and feel of a big-ticket production, albeit torqued towards millennial melancholy, complete with a muted, blue-grey colour palette by cinematographer Bradford Young., Watching it, I was excited that such a strange piece of science fiction got made-and disappointed ..., Denis Villeneuves latest is an artier - certainly moodier and less entertaining - version of M. Night Shyamalans Signs."
 Fences ,1,"Davis went big...debuting film actor Jovan Adepo shines..., Fences is one of the most prescient movies out now., The performances by each of its six main characters... combined with Washingtons gripping direction (inciting a mix of terror, madness, and pity), FENCES is simply extraordinary. It is not to be missed., Denzel swells with dangerous charisma. Viola works high emotion from every one of her many lines. They are so good they almost convince us were watching a movie., There is a powerful drama here about the legacy of racism but Washington doesnt know how to liberate it from the stage., The symbolism is heavy handed. Its like being repeatedly clobbered by Troys prized baseball bat: Rose takes a phone call that delivers bad news; a lightning flash illuminates the crucifix on her wall., As it is, we are able to enjoy a theatrical experience, and some really fine acting, with minimal obvious changes made to the original stage production., This is a portrait of a doomed marriage that allows its stars to explode., Fences is the most classical piece of drama in the best picture line-up for this years Oscars, with outstanding performances by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis., Denzel Washington is a class act, and he has given us a classy piece of work., Fences is a filmed play that never seems anything else: a yatter of life of death, directed by Denzel Washington from August Wilsons Pulitzer-winning 1983 play., Washington is customarily magnetic, but this is Davis film., The great coup Washington delivers, beyond framing his co-stars virtuous anguish so well, is the risky, brilliant, and frequently alienating performance he gives as Troy., This feels more like a record of a stage performance than a film in its own right. That, though, doesnt lessen its impact in the slightest or take away from the searing brilliance of the two leads., Washington is very good, but its Davis - hurt, proud, determined - whos the star of this show., A simply extraordinary film without crashes, bangs and wallops but full of towering performances delivered with intelligence, power and heart., The stunning acting and August Wilsons timeless words will captivate you again and again., Washingtons direction cant match his acting - Fences is great filmed theater but not exactly great cinema. But theres no questioning Washingtons skill as an actors director, and the ensemble is first-rate, particularly Davis., Washington has pledged to bring all of plays in the cycle to the screen. The good news is he started with a home run., Yes, Fences suffers somewhat from the bare-bones transferal of the action from stage to screen but the material is so compelling that viewers can easily lose sight of the movie\s play nature."
 Hacksaw Ridge ,1,"Gibsons robust directorial technique brings an undeniable punch to the combat scenes ... Elsewhere in the film, however, theres a sledgehammer lack of subtlety that is only partially mitigated by Andrew Garfields impressive performance., If they gave out awards for most movie in a movie, then no other movie need turn up., A rousing tale of Pacific War heroism that has more in common with jingoistic Wayne staples such as Sands of Iwo Jima or The Green Berets than anything in the 21st century, this is wearily formulaic film-making., Vintage Mel-odrama., Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned war film, melded with a kind of new-fashioned explicitly violent drama., Mel Gibsons Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best Second World War movies since Terrence Malicks The Thin Red Line. It is also a wildly contradictory affair, combining folksiness with a pathological quality., A sterling modern war picture with an intriguing moral twist., Occasionally soapy on the homefront but cataclysmic in combat, this is a worthy addition to the WWII canon., Hacksaw Ridge, the first movie Mel Gibson has directed in a decade, is about as Mel Gibson as you can get: grisly, devout, and patriotic, with a deeply complicated core., A fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd., Gibson has made a movie thats nearly pathological in its love of violence-but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks., Hacksaw Ridge is a fine motion picture, one whose themes and ideas obviously speak to the filmmaker, and if Doss story has helped change him as far as being a decent human being is concerned, that makes it all even better., As director, Gibsons approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera., For the sheer spectacle of the battle scenes, Hacksaw Ridge will go down as one of Gibsons finest contributions to cinema., By the time Hacksaw Ridge reaches its necessary messianic finish, its hard to not be moved by the boggling heroism of this dutiful man., War is hell, but Hacksaw Ridge sacrifices that truth in favour of something far more insincere., The battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge are among the most violent captured on film - and also the most urgent., The scenes in battle are as harrowing as any ever put on screen. We are in the midst of utter carnage and chaos., Hacksaw Ridge is being touted as Gibsons comeback. Is it also an atonement? Whats clear is that Gibson has made a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put to the test in an arena of violent conflict - a movie you dont want to miss., If the films director were anyone but Gibson, a fixture on or even atop Hollywoods enemies list, it would be expecting several Oscar nominations."
 Hell or High Water ,1,"Just as it taps into a dying corner of American society, Hell or High Water resurrects the power of western mayhem done right., We will never get another Howard Hawks or Raoul Walsh, but, every now and then, we see a film that pays homage to their spirit., This neo-Western works splendidly as a self-contained tale of loyalty, loss and redemption, with polished turns from a smoldering Chris Pine and spunky Ben Foster., This classic, thoughtful, and evocative storytelling lets audiences have a guilty pleasure watching two wretches get payback on a banking system thats ripping off old ladies., Hell or High Water is a contemporary western with pick-up trucks instead of horses. But some things never change., Theres not a moment out of place, not a shot that stays too long. If David McKenzie makes a better film in his career, hell be lucky., Scottish director David Mackenzie employs the keen eye of an outsider to evoke this very particular world. The film is firmly planted in reality, down to the smallest detail., Hell or High Water isnt the kind of flashy film that arrived with a lot of fanfare and it certainly isnt your average heist movie, it sneaks up on you and will surprise you with its grace and depth., The whole movie offers ample evidence that Mackenzie has stealthily achieved an unassuming but utterly genuine mastery of his craft., art heist, part western for the Occupy generation, this sharply plotted thriller is a triumph for both director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan., Theres no Bonnie and Clyde-style glamour but the film has an emotional depth that you dont often find in a heist thriller., A smartly crafted heist thriller that quietly peels back the layers from its macho male characters to reveal the pain and tenderness inside., As with Starred Up, Mackenzies family-centric prison drama, Hell or High Water is full of grim nooks and crannies., For Mackenzie, a British filmmaker whose career to date has been nomadic, the movie feels like finally finding the right key for a lock., Unexpected directions, sharp humour and powerful performances., Taut, tense and burnished by Jeff Bridges at his best. This is a deceptively simple tale of Texan cops and robbers that drags the Old West into the modern age., All of the performers in this film, right down to the bit players, are quite good, but Bridges demonstrates yet again that he is one of the finest actors in America., From a purely narrative perspective, theres nothing new here but like a new arrangement of a familiar tune, the slight changes make it fresh and enjoyable., Mackenzie happens to be Scottish, but hes made the best American Western in years., Hell or High Water isnt just a great time at the movies, its one of the years best pictures."
 Hidden Figures ,1,"Its a story of greatness demanding acknowledgement., The movie features outstanding performances and pays tribute to three pioneering Black women who played a central role at NASA in the early 1960s during the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union., Hidden Figures presented three brilliant black women who just wanted to do their jobs., Hidden Figures is more about race than the space race, both of which are conquered with grace and girl power., Through strong performances, sensitive direction and the strength of its source material, Hidden Figures transcends cliché to become a genuinely moving, inspirational tale of perseverance, strength and love., The pragmatism that flows through Hidden Figures provides a beacon of hope in a modern era that feels marked by uncertainty and despair., The performances are warm and good-humored, without exception. It is absolutely an inspirational movie., This drama, which puts black women at its center, is so triumphant, highlighting both the brilliance and lives of three women whose stories have been neglected in history books, and at the same time it elevates the profile of three great actresses., Its a terrific story told with a lot of verve and charm., This splashy, feelgood period piece is every bit as enjoyable as a best picture Oscar-nominated blockbuster could hope to be., Almost every one of the fudges makes the film more entertaining and less truthful., No people have ever deserved their own movie more than they do. And what a lovely movie this is., As Melfi proved in his previous film, St Vincent, hes good with actors and is a competent storyteller, but he cant resist underlining things that are already obvious., Yes, the story may have been panel-beaten into a gleaming, Oscar-friendly shape. That Hidden Figures is still so entertaining and moving is due in large part to a hugely likeable central trio of performances., This is an immensely likeable film and one that draws overdue attention to a story that has been neglected for far too long., Hidden Figures is not a good movie. Sorry, but its not., Its touching, sobering, sometimes funny, this lesson in racial history ..., Hidden Figures isnt pushing the cinematic boat out in any new directions, but it steers its prescribed course nimbly and nicely., The performances here are wonderful and it is undoubtedly a feel good film with its warmth, vitality and empowering energy., Essentially Parabolas & Prejudice, it isnt the most nuanced piece of work out this month. But nuance be damned - an uplifting plea for equality, this is a story calibrated for maximum effect."
 La La Land ,1,"It is joyful. It leaps off the screen., A gorgeously photographed, unashamedly nostalgic, bittersweet marriage of the modern and the traditional, proving Chazelles fantastic eye for musical sequences., With its candy-coated color palette and Emma Stones earth-shattering performance, theres plenty of love found within La La Land., It makes it more difficult to just let something like La La Land just passively wash over you when, however well-intentioned, the film hearkens back to a time when black humanity onscreen was deliberately hamstrung., The movie has charm, at least, if nothing else. And as an attempt to pay homage to a vanishing world, La La Land is as dutiful as it is endearing\u200a-\u200asweet, if a little sour, too., Its a story as old as Hollywood and jazz, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone feel like a pairing for the ages., Dont get me wrong, LA LA LAND is fun and cutesy, and made me leave the theater with a big, goofy smile on my face. But theres one distinct difference between good movie musicals and great movie musicals., Its just gorgeous, like a flipbook made of dreamy vintage postcards that are somehow about contemporary life in Los Angeles., A toasty splash of sound and color ., La La Land remembers when movies were magical and fun, blending nostalgia and contemporaneity in a candy-sweet love letter to cinema., It is simply a splendid continuation of cinemas ever-evolving love affair with song and dance., La La Land ravishes from densely populated beginning to eye-moistening denouement., The film is at its most convincing in those intimate exchanges between Gosling, with his melted eyes, and Stone, with her anime face., La La Land with caveats is still more wonderful than almost anything else., If it were any more enchanting, the musical romantic comedy La La Land ... would break your heart., Open-hearted gushy romanticism in CinemaScope. Whats not to love?, Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who dont like musicals - and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces., La La Land is a worthy showcase for the magnificent Stones talents, and she is heartbreaking throughout., If you havent already fallen for this gauzy romp through the city of Angels at this point, you surely will during the last scene, with its bittersweet homage to the way times goes by., Chazelles filmmaking exuberance and the energy and sweetness of his two stars give this thin soup considerable tang."
 Manchester by the Sea ,1,"In Manchester by the Sea, Kenneth Lonergan again explores the depth of grief., Writer/director Kenneth Lonergans MANCHESTER BY THE SEA made me leave the theater feeling empty... it could easily be filed away as just another white male angst narrative., Manchester by the Sea may be a potent examination of grief, family and self-imposed solitude, but its also oddly life-affirming and uplifting., Not a moment in the film is wasted; though on the long side, this is from start to finish a rewarding and strangely beautiful drama with a conclusion that is immensely satisfying in its touching understatement., With an outstandingly icy Casey Affleck as a mournful loner drawn back into his old fold, Kenneth Lonergans New England community study is a masterful, darkly American account of a heart in the dead of January., In Manchester by the Sea, men are soulful and women are shallow, a gender gap that wounds this otherwise compelling drama., A drama of rage and grief that stands on the brink of the inexpressible., This is about life as it is lived in the real world, with unassuageable pain, loose ends untied, life lessons unlearned. Life with no narrative closure., Each scene brims with self-contained humour and drama, regardless of whether it moves the story along or simply fills in background colour., That Manchester By The Sea is so absorbing is down to Lonergans painstaking directorial style and to a superb Method-style performance from the lead actor., Masterfully told and beautifully acted, Manchester By The Sea is a shattering yet graceful elegy of loss and grief., For all its moments of discord, Manchester By the Sea sings its lonely song with tremendous heart and soul., Lonergan is so precise with his actors, the sense of place, and the level control of tone that you feel him methodically striving here to avoid false notes., This is without question my favorite film of the year, Unforced acting couples with a nuanced, insightful script to tell a story that, although seemingly simple, is achingly complex., The sadness of Manchester by the Sea is the kind of sadness that makes you feel more alive, rather than less, to the preciousness of things., Affleck is magnificent, but the movie is something less than that, because it cant completely overcome some built-in challenges. Even so, Manchester by the Sea deserves honors for being so different, and for working on the mind in a particular way, Manchester by the Sea is a stunner, delivering in ways that defy easy description., Its initial enigma seems to need no explanation; yet, once deciphered, the film does not falter but moves only deeper into the emotional territory it charts., Its painful and tragic, yet its cut with elements of humor and laughter. Just like life."
 Call Me by Your Name ,1,"A modern-day Visconti, Italian director Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) grants us entry into a world not only of wealth but of culture, which can be just as liberating., Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting., The characters beauty and intellectual perfection is so consummate that I couldnt entirely believe that these people actually had genitals-that they could ever sweat or incur sunburn., This is a beautiful film -- one that is startlingly real. It feels so blisteringly sensual and in the moment, that its almost impossible to ignore., Call Me By Your Name can be considered an idealistic film, but that\s only natural for something about young people experiencing something wonderful for the first time., This coming-of-age love story is all texture, tone and nuance...Luca Guadagnino has made a lovely cinematic feather. And it floats down beautifully, riding a soft breeze of melancholy and grace., Hammer is exceptionally fine in the film... while Chalamet is perfect as the indecisive youth who is drawn to this exotic stranger in ways he himself cant fully comprehend., Its a story less about the characters involved than it is about the dynamics between them, a late addition to the Symposiums accounts of the great god Love., Call Me By Your Name is a visually stunning coming-of-age story that boasts a star-making performance by Chalamet., A love affair is inevitable, but Guadagnino doesnt skim over Elios prolonged longing, which is what makes Call Me by Your Name most potent as a coming-of-age picture, not a mere romance., Despite all its pain, love is always worth it, the film argues-and makes you believe., The film is beautifully shot and the performances are outstanding., You may not realize how strong the acting is until you replay the movie in your head later., Chalamet is a revelation., Its a piercing glimpse of a young mans bright, confounding first love, the kind of love that brings disorientation and rhapsody., Slowly, as if in a delicate tango, the two move toward each other, and Call Me By Your Name becomes the story of a connection, both sexual and emotional., Few films handle coming of age with as much grace and humanity as Call Me By Your Name and the audience is as transformed by the experience as the characters., Call Me by Your Name is a perfect, lazy, worry-free day, practically devoid of any real-world concerns and absolutely dripping with intellectual and artistic stimulation, and all manner of sexual enticement., A complicated movie, erotic yet never graphic, heartfelt yet highly stylized. Chalamet delivers one of the years best performances., One of the years most romantic movies, and also one of the best."
 Dunkirk ,1,"The visuals, the structure, the use of sound and music, and the simple presence of a beating heart - all come together in a whole that is truly breathtaking., Dunkirk shows off Nolans own techniques as a filmmaker to make for a film that is technically, if not completely narratively, lustrous., The strange problem posed by the movie is, in terms of what it sets out to do, completely of a piece but missing the surge of feeling that would make that thing worth doing., Dunkirk is absolutely riveting, but not quite the high-minded salute to the Greatest Generation the marketing may have you believe., Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale., When Dunkirk ended, I realized it wasnt Dunkirk I wanted to watch: It was the sequel., A genuinely powerful and emotionally resonant glimpse into the fog of war, told viscerally and masterfully by a top-notch filmmaker in full command of his gifts. But Nolan indulges in a structural flourish that, for this viewer, simply doesnt play., Few films have stripped war down to its terrifying, thrilling essence as Christopher Nolans Dunkirk, and few films have turned war into such an overwhelming, almost physical experience., Nolans sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character., It isnt a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing., Its not always easy to know whats going on in Christopher Nolans Dunkirk-which makes the film seem all the more convincing as an evocation of war., Virtual reality without the headset, Nolan calls it, and it\s no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen., Occasional bursts of flames, imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters, come as a relief from the chromatic tedium., The movie works. Time and again, the action swells and dips, like a wave, then suddenly delivers a salty slap in the face., It is hard to imagine a better tribute to this victory of survival than Nolans spare, stunning, extraordinarily ambitious film., A film that will doubtless become the definitive cinematic depiction of this remarkable chapter of history., Technically awe-inspiring, narratively inventive and thematically complex, Dunkirk reinvigorates its genre with a war movie that is both harrowing and smart., Its an extraordinary undertaking, and Nolan delivers a spellbinding ride. Out of the depths or man-made horror, hes created a gripping tale of human resolve., Despite all the substandard characterization, what we do see sucks us in enough to keep us invested and, at times, riveted., This is a magnificent achievement accomplished with staggering buoyancy and grace, the victory of survival its own form of heroism worthy of celebration."
 Get Out ,1,"Peele seduces, subverts and manipulates audience expectations - as the masters Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter, and Stanley Kubrick did before him., This brilliantly provocative first feature from comic turned writer-director Jordan Peele proves that the best way to get satire to a mass audience is to call it horror., Everything in Get Out seems innocuous on first blush., Kudos to Peele for tackling a painful subject in such a massively entertaining and thoroughly memorable fashion. Full review in Japanese, What makes Get Out a worthwhile experience is Jordan Peeles skillful genre intervention., Its a game-changer., Director Peele, who also scripted, is very good at writing barbed dialogue, and as the film proceeds the audience is likely to feel as uncomfortable as Chris., Its Guess Whos Coming to Dinner made over in the spirit of Rosemarys Baby, with accessories inspired by Meet the Fockers., Peele plays the suspense like a maestro wielding a Stradivarius - each tightly wound string used to create a sense of foreboding and anticipation that Hitchcock himself wouldve been jealous of., Jordan Peeles semi-parodic horror film Get Out has a complexity worthy of its historical moment., By focusing the storyline on a particular form of racism -- the kind thats often disguised as peculiar envy -- Get Out reveals something more insidious., Mostly Peele creates a lovely, off-kilter mood, riffing with tremendous visual poise on all sorts of classics, including Seconds, Guess Whos Coming to Dinner and The Stepford Wives., Beneath the beatific smile of 21st-century liberalism, Get Out finds the still grinning ghoulish skull of age-old servitude and exploitation unveiled during a rollercoaster ride into a very American nightmare., Peele succeeds where sometimes even more experienced filmmakers fail: Hes made an agile entertainment whose social and cultural observations are woven so tightly into the fabric that youre laughing even as youre thinking, and vice-versa., In a double whammy of satire, Get Out upends all the expected tropes of the horror movie and gives middle-class white liberals a thorough skewering., To call it the most important movie of the year so far makes it sound possibly rather worthy. Thats not true at all. Get Out is a comment on a highly complex situation thats also a total blast., The most forceful and inventive American horror film since It Follows., The film has more to do with discomfort and envy than blind hatred. What a strange marvel it is., Is it too early to call this a modern genre classic?, Its a brilliantly mischievous, unsettling movie."
 Lady Bird ,1,"Lady Bird combines wisdom and tenderness, humor and grace. Its light-footed without being lightweight. And it captures, with great feeling, the turbulence of a girl growing up. I cant recommend it enough., Greta Gerwigs directorial debut, Lady Bird, is the millisecond of possibility, the speck of unflinching nerve, which might only occur once in our lives., It is a female coming-of-age story that is both nostalgic and unflinching, and it will ensnare you deeply in its grasp., The densely packed detail which makes this such a luminous work shows Gerwig to be an uncommonly alert filmmaker., One of the finest teen comedies ever. Movie perfection, One element of the films genius is its ability to root us firmly in Lady Birds perspective. It does more., Its joyful, forward-rushing narrative rhythm captures the feeling of adolescence ending before it has barely begun., As teen movies go, its supremely sophisticated, capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere., While there is an acute authorial intelligence informing the transitions between scenes, the steady trot of clipped vignettes comes to seem monotonous and somewhat evasive, a way to move along before anything too hard and hurtful happens., Like many wonderful actresses with a gift for words (think Julie Delpy, Sarah Polley and Lake Bell) Gerwig has slipped behind the camera to create something quietly political., Gerwigs deft handling of script, camera and actors is all the more impressive given that this is her first film as solo director., This is a coming-of-age story thats affecting without ever being sentimental, and feels absolutely true -- like remembering the teenager you once were, even if you were never a Lady Bird (or Debee) exactly. A rare bird indeed., A gloriously funny and wistfully autobiographical coming-of-age comedy., If Gerwig is capable of all this in her first solo feature, who knows what feats of woodwork shell craft for us next., Writer-director Gerwig manages brilliantly the delicate feat of portraying the vulnerabilities and eccentricities of the townsfolk without patronising them., Lady Bird is an absolute charmer of a movie. We genuinely care about this lovely, rebellious girl and we want her to be happy., Its almost too hard to write about Lady Bird precisely because its so brilliant that no words could possibly capture its spirit and convey why this film absolutely has to be seen, and loved., A coming-of-age story like no other, Lady Bird is smart, emotional, funny and completely original. Rarely has a directorial debut been so assured, so singular and so heartwarmingly affecting., Almost everything here bespeaks Gerwig, including the casts tendency to act one line or dramatic moment with breezy brio, as if already on the run to the next. Very GG., The characters may be messy, but Gerwigs writing and direction are elegantly precise. One of the best ensemble casts of the year."
 Green Book ,2,"Yet Farrelly and his cast deliver the cliches with such sincerity and good cheer that the film won me over anyway., An enthusiastic and well-intentioned but ultimately clichéd approach is abundantly evident in the final product., Green Book is a glib, caricatured and insensitive movie that reduces an enduring, dangerous societal problem to a calculated fable with a happy ending. Full review in Japanese, Is it a feel-good charmer poised to rake in greenbacks and Oscar gold? You bet! But dont let that keep you away from this overall well balanced (and timed) look forward from the safe distance of Americas motley past., While Green Book is one of the lesser films to bear the Farrelly imprimatur, it can be appreciated for its role in revealing so nakedly the rules of the prestige picture sweepstakes., The screenplay essentially turns Shirley into a black man who thematically shapeshifts into whoever will make the story appealing to white audiences - and thats inexcusable., Green Book feels like a movie lost in time, and we have to do better. We demand better., A flawed but oddly joyful movie elevated far above its limitations by two sublime performances., Mahershala Alis performance shines through despite ill-judged moments from director Peter Farrelly., A bizarre fish-out-of-water comedy masquerading as a serious awards-season contender by pretending to address the deep wound of racial inequality while demonstrating its profound inability, intellectually and dramatically, to do that., So much fun in the moment, you almost feel bad later on for realising it doesnt add up., This is a movie about insulting stereotypes and the dirigiste devices of organised racism that delivers its own, audience-insulting stereotypes, with a tonne of dramatic directionalism., Where Green Book runs into trouble is if you scratch even a millimetre beneath its fuzzy, warm surface., Ali and Mortensen make a tremendously engaging odd couple. Both give such nuanced and well-observed performances that most audiences will swallow the sentimental moralising as easily as Tony digests his hot dogs., There are a few cheesy moments as the two men learn life lessons from each other but the acting is a joy, the co-stars coaxing complexities from their characters., Well, its a handsomely made and watchable picture and there is a real warmth in Ali and Mortensens performances., Just enough (laughing) gas in the tank to merit its two-hour runtime., The gears engage. The motor runs smoothly. The destination is achieved. There are worse things in heaven and earth., A supremely likeable film. Its message might seem obvious and its template overcooked, but it boasts a warm heart, with two astoundingly good lead performances to guide it home., Farrelly is seeking to entertain with Green Book, not to provoke. The performances of his actors - Mortensen, rarely better, and Ali - make it all worthwhile."
 Black Panther ,1,"This soulful sequel teams an emotional tribute to late star Chadwick Boseman with some spectacular visual action. A maturity milestone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starring Angela Bassett and Winston Duke., Kind of a mixed bag, but worth seeing if you liked the first one. , The MCU’s mechanics are too oppressive to allow for true mournful meditation., The first Black Panther... set a bar Wakanda Forever didnt come close to matching. But taken on its own terms, as a superhero sequel tasked with serving an unusually wide range of needs, it stands as a different kind of accomplishment., Wow! You’ll say that over and over again as this mind-blowing, superhero epic unfolds. Wow!, Wakanda Forever may not be the perfect Marvel movie, but it prove its worthiness as a bridge – not merely between Phase 4 and Phase 5... but from the bleakness of loss to a stable place from which a new generation can move forward. , The most unlikely Marvel film ever... they take these really small bites of grieving, and they can extend them and live in them, and still be able to tell an engaging action-oriented story. , I find I respect Coogler’s sequel more than I actually enjoyed it, and that’s as disappointing a turn of events as any I could have imagined., The emotional core is raw, credible and affecting., The opening and closing sequences of Wakanda Forever will make your heart ache. But at 2hrs 41mins, this is also one of the longest films in the MCU. And there are long stretches in it which border on boredom. I was weepy but also weary. , Coogler pulls off an incredible feat, despite some story stumbles, creating a superhero film that is emotionally affecting, politically and culturally urgent, and that pays loving tribute not just to T’Challa but Chadwick Boseman too., After a spate of manic superhero blockbusters that ricocheted from one digital spectacle to another, this one takes its time with character and plot but doesn’t develop either to any satisfying degree., A thoughtful and mature exploration of communal grief in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a fitting tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman., A stunning tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman., Fans of the MCU will doubtless embrace this at times moving sequel in a big way; for more serious cinemagoers this will remain a foreign country., The underwater sequences intended to visualize Talokan are drab and washed-out to the point of distraction, and even a street-level car chase shot at night is near-impossible to track, all the darkness seemingly intended to cover for lackluster CGI., Almost like being at a funeral while trying to shush the kids who are playing with their Iron Man toys. ... Its more fascinating than your average comic book movie, even though it doesnt work as a comic book movie., It can’t top the original and the absence of Chadwick Boseman hurts real bad, but Ryan Coogler’s sequel proves to be more than cringey franchise building by putting women of color in charge (yay to Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright) and watching them fly., For all its comic-book violence, over-the-top villainy, and too dark CGI, at its core this is a film about dealing with loss., “Wakanda Forever” is the first blockbuster wake, and it’s powered not by vibranium but by its vibrant and fully felt emotions."
 BlacKkKlansman ,1,"The contemporary elements dont necessarily trip you up too much, because youre in the middle of a period piece, and its a great balance that he strikes because we have been waiting for a return of Spike., The filmmaker rips from the headlines, but the struggles remain the same., Theres nobody left in Hollywood making broad, sweeping, lively political melodramas like Spike Lee., Its just about perfect in balance of tone, and its easily Spike Lees best film in years., A kitchen sink and kaleidoscopic study of cultural and institutional racism in America., What I especially love is how the movie refuses to offer up any pat or easy answers., Spike Lee is one of the best directors of his generation. BlacKKKlansman assures him of that title, Until the closing shots of BlacKkKlansman, director and co-writer Spike Lee does more than control the rage. He refines it with riotous wit into a stiletto, and is all the more lethal for that., BlacKkKlansman slips seamlessly from borderline-absurdist humour to all-too-real horror, conjuring an urgent blend of sociopolitical period satire and contemporary wake-up call., ...a movie that has to be reckoned with, about a subject that we seem doomed -- hopelessly -- to reckon with., BlacKkKlansmans determination to be everything for everybody - comedy/ melodrama, wish-fulfilment fable/awful warning - proves its unexpected, unconventional master-choice., BlacKkKlansman blends comic irony and outspoken polemic but still works very effectively as a hardboiled crime drama., Lees most entertaining and thought-provoking film in years., Spike Lee isnt subtle, his is a sledgehammer approach. But being delicate wasnt the point. This is a film that needs to be seen., Lees motivating anger produces a unique, electrifying charge., Stallworth recognizes that white voice is a seductive fiction, like many of the customs of association cherished within the K.K.K., For all its revelations of racist rot at the core of American society, Lee also offers a clear, specific, and wondrous, if wary, view of change thats possible because, at one time and to some extent, it actually happened., Lee would contend, I guess, that the sober approach will no longer suffice-that the age we inhabit is too drunk on its own craziness. He has a point., An entertaining jaunt through the 70s, with some dutiful grappling over the enduring question of race in America thrown in..., This is one of his best films because he marries the anger and intensity with the restraint and poetry that hes so good at visually."
 Roma ,1,"Roma will be studied for years as a landmark in cinematic storytelling, made even more meaningful because it pays tribute to a character who is usually in the background., In Cuaróns films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before., Its beautiful story, he shot it himself along side writing and directing, at this stage we can see it in a bunch of different places, its on Netflix & in theaters, but go see it in theaters!, Aparicio, in her acting debut, is remarkable., Cuarón fills every corner of the frame, just as Fellini did, so that the eye has to roam the screen as though scouring a fresco. But for all the bustle and brio, its a visually lucid movie., This has plenty to say about class relations too, but whats most impressive about it is how the Mexican writer-director-cinematographer-editor transforms even his political observations into the stuff of big-screen spectacle., A movie like Roma is rare - something thats intimate yet also grand., For all its worthy intentions, Roma is little more than the righteous affirmation of good intentions., Roma captures, as well as any film I have seen, the spirit of magical realism, without ever hinting at the supernatural. Its magic is pure, stunning cinematic technique., Alfonso Cuaron\s new film, Roma, gives you so much to see in each new vignette, in every individual composition, in fact, that a second viewing becomes a pleasurable necessity rather than a filmgoing luxury., Alive in a way that few movies are, Roma is a sumptuous piece of filmmaking, a gorgeous look at life on a grand scale told through the prism of one family., Roma is Cuaróns love letter to his nanny, to his mother, to his siblings, and to Mexico. Its as pure as cinema can get., Narratively, not a lot happens during the opening 60-70 minutes, but Cuaron is marinating us so that later events have an uncommonly strong impact., Cuaróns film is quotidian and extraordinary at the same time. It is about change and how we adapt and grow. It is about love and sometimes the lack of it. It is a rapturous magnum opus, that is heartbreaking, devastating, and life affirming all at once., It is the clarity of Cuaróns eye, and the sea-like sway of his remembrance, that compel you to trust the tale he tells., Alongside fascinating social observations and surprising outbreaks of humour, Roma features one or two of the most heart-wrenching scenes in recent cinema., This is a film that alternatively shows humanity in all its ugly glory as well is its quiet moments of beauty., Nothing much happens, yet there is so much to watch., In the end, the film belongs to Aparicio, whose unmannered performance gives Roma an extra dimension of poetic realism., Roma achieves the rare feat of making the personal authentically political, not through explicit polemic or tortured metaphors, but simply by observing life with enough perspective to reflect it in all its contradictions."
 A Star Is Born ,1,"Pop singer Lady Gaga is quite good as the wife... she subtly and convincingly manages the characters transformation from vulnerable ingenue to self-confident celebrity., Even in its fourth rendition, A Star is Born hits the right emotional highs., What really works about this version is the fact that Bradley Cooper co-wrote it, he produced it and stars in it, and put it together but he incorporates little elements of Lady Gagas Story., A Star Is Born is a fantastic film (...) but its contempt for pop music is disappointing., In the end, A Star is Born becomes a touching film hampered by its own legacy., In its new incarnation, A Star Is Born presents a beautifully told and hugely affecting love story., A Star is Born foregrounds all of the ways Jackson and Ally are enamored with each other, the intimacy that enhanced their bond and the affection that inspired their songs., Somehow, though, the bloat is almost appropriate in a story about excesses, and the devastating pitfalls of fame. A Star is Born portrays both poignantly, movingly, well., While imperfect, A Star Is Born is a satisfying and emotionally evocative epic. If only it had managed to maintain the intoxicating allure of its first hour., A Star is Born doesnt push any cinematic boundaries. It isnt edgy or provocative. But its emotionally rich and hugely satisfying., Some of the best performances of the year...Cooper is going to be a great director if he can continue this kind of filmmaking momentum., If youre able to forget the stars that have gone before, A Star is Born is a very professional tear-jerker with some very loud music, and for many that will be enough., What Cooper gets about A Star Is Born is the degree to which it is about the physics of love and work. This may be the only mythic narrative about a two-career marriage. Its a melodrama where every action has an equal and opposite reaction., It may be that every generation gets the A Star Is Born it deserves, though what we did to deserve this one is anyone\s guess., Co-written by Cooper, who also helped write some of the films music, the script doesnt exactly bubble with wit but it doesnt have to. What matters is that it gives both leads the chance to charm one another - and us., At its huge, pulsating heart this is a story about lovers desperately trying to save one another - from the loss of integrity in an industry that disdains it and from self-destructive impulses with roots too old and deep to be touched., The problem is whenever Cooper turns the film away from his best asset (Gaga) and into a vanity production., Bradley Coopers 2018 rendition of A Star Is Born manages the impossible: bringing this seemingly old-fashioned story about fame into the present while retaining its classical, timeless appeal., What Cooper persuasively depicts is the fear factor of stardom-the sense of vulnerability, of a position thats both powerful and fragile., As deep and resonant as Bradley Coopers drawl, and as bright as Lady Gagas screen future."
 Vice ,1,"What is perhaps most remarkable about Bales and Adamss performances is that they supply depth and nuance to a film whose director appears to have had no appetite for either quality., Despite this ongoing fishing analogy, it never actually manages to land the big fish., When a movies premise is that its subject single-handedly moulded recent history, you want more depth and grandeur than this one provides., Bale credited Satan for inspiration for the role, and it shows., These days, everyone is yelling, and that includes the makers of Vice. The title has a double-meaning but Id suggest a third: watching the film feels like having your head stuck in a..., You would struggle to find many nuances in Bale\s performance, but this is a grand example of what Orson Welles used to call King acting., Its a skilled piece of comic acting which has the unlikely effect of making Cheney buffoonish as well as sinister... But McKay is quick to remind us what happened on Cheneys watch., Its a more ambitious political satire...Because its about real people, real politicians and real deranged ambitions, and it places much of the blame for todays geopolitical ills...directly at their door. Oh, and its also very funny., Vice is a big fat mess of a film about a big fat mess (courtesy of script and make-up department) of an anti-hero., Its an exhilarating explosion of a biopic., It is a head-spinning shock-and-awe satire that comes in hot then cranks up the thermostat to infernal - a Molotov cocktail of biopic, documentary and black comedy, with a thrillingly short fuse., Bales a riot, but its The Big Short 2., You have to admit that this cynical and methodically researched film isnt pulling any punches., Vice worked my last nerve. Its true, I turned on it early, but trust me when I say it did nothing to endear itself to me as it went on., In theory, theres no reason why this approach shouldnt work -- if the jokes were better and the black comedy was blacker. But McKay isnt really interested in Cheney as anything but a target., ... the best American film of the year, a stinging satire of which Jonathan Swift might not have been ashamed., Vice isnt a dishonest movie, exactly. It just enables dishonesty., Given the present partisan chasm, though, it feels nihilistic to laugh at a movie that so puckishly delights in further polarizing Republicans and Democrats., You cannot simply sit and absorb this movie. Love it or hate it, you are one of its characters., In Adam McKays free-ranging, tone-shifting, darkly funny, super-meta, hit-and-miss, absurdist biopic Vice, Bale nails it as the resilient, backstabbing, front-stabbing, ruthlessly ambitious Cheney."
 Parasite ,2,"I think its a career peak for Bong Joon-ho., Watching that drama -- the bricks sort of build and then topple -- is so satisfying., Bong Joon-hos work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. Hell make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you., This is what a true masterpiece looks like., Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture., A tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul., Far from hiding, the films beguiling charm stokes the deeply dystopian vision of its maker. In Bongs world, despite tokens like a cell phone or pizza dinners, social mobility doesnt quite exist., I think this film is as close to perfect as anything I have seen in the last 10 years. Its just fantastic., Using industrial-strength social satire, Bong Joon Ho strips the veneer off the myth of classlessness, giving an outrageously entertaining instant classic., It works on every level which is, perhaps, fitting for a film about levels and whether you are at the top or bottom in life., Parasite works as entertainment and analysis, treat and treatise., An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core., Though we largely root for the Kims, Bong doesnt allow anything as simple as rich versus poor, good versus bad. No wonder this movie speaks to global audiences - its a parable about our capitalist world., A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer., A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-hos already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire thats as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic., If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, its a test youre just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too., Let\s just say that by Parasite\s conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet., It isnt an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. Youll see strange and wonderful things along the way., It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy., Parasite is a beautiful movie, wonderfully acted, impeccably shot."
 Ford v Ferrari ,1,"Ford v Ferrari may relish in the high life, but its final moments feel devastatingly hollow., While Ford v. Ferrari finishes first on a technical level, it serves as a myopic altar to a sport and era of white-male dominance., You see the concentration. You see the sweat. You see the danger. You see the madness., Ford v Ferrari is a little too long; some scenes leave unnecessary skidmark trails. But the movie still has amiable style and energy to spare. Its fast but never furious., Think Iron Man and Captain America, only its a (mostly) true story and whats at stake is not the fate of the universe, nor even an auto race, but the glorious, endless pursuit of perfection., It is a beautifully controlled and assembled piece of filmmaking., While the movie has its share of racetrack thrills in keeping with a cinematic tradition that began with the silent classic Ben Hur, its the personal and professional friendship between Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles that gives the movie traction., Its a far from perfect film, but a richly entertaining one, with a twist that only devoted petrolheads will know is coming., Its still impeccably made, with Mangold distilling the story into two essential parts: the thrill of the game, and the thrill of watching people who are good at their jobs do their jobs., Theres still lots to enjoy about the film, which provides us with two wonderful lead performances, exciting speed races, and car executives wearing some of the most beautifully tailored suits this side of Mad Men., The film weathers its two-and-a-half-hour running time easily, even as it navigates a cheerfully formulaic sports movie structure., Hitting the screen like a shot of pure unfiltered adrenaline, director James Mangolds Ford v Ferrari is an outstanding historical character study., Ford v Ferrari takes the straightforward ethos of car racing-where the winner is whoever is the fastest-and lays bare the egotism and greed required for such a triumph., This film has no ambition except to entertain, and it does so exceedingly well. Thats not something I take for granted., Mangold takes Ford v. Ferrari out of the simple realm of the genre without entirely losing the vibe., Even Henry Ford II gets the message here: Sometimes you have to go along with the ride., One of the best ensemble casts of the year, in one of the best movies ever made about auto racing., Ford v Ferrari is made the way Hollywood used to make them, a glorious throwback that combines a smart modern sensibility with the best of traditional storytelling., I bought into Matt Damons character completely... The race sequences are terrific., Its a new and emotionally complex model of an old-fashioned audience-pleaser, with wonderful performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon and a resonant soul to go with its smarts."
 The Irishman ,1,"It didnt take a genius to see that television was finally poised to win the war against movies. I just didnt expect my teacher to be leading the charge against theatrical exhibition., The Irishman is a much more deliberate and weighty gangster film - by comparison, Goodfellas is a riot. But its a vibe that works in its gravitas., The affecting, ruminative finale and the melancholic last scene leaves a metaphorical door ajar in our hearts, a deep hollow thats hard to fill..., Despite its length, The Irishman is riveting. It confirms Scorsese as one of the great American filmmakers., There are 209 minutes in The Irishman and not one of them is wasted., Whether seen on the big screen or a small one, The Irishman is among 2019s best motion pictures and should receive its share of Oscar attention in 2020., The Irishman moves slowly and pensively, invests in the natural rhythm of conversations and stops to smell the roses., There was a real pleasure in seeing Scorcese... doing this sort of stuff that he became known for and celebrated for., Its the ultimate fusing of Scorseses two sides... And even though it takes a while to get there, the movie is a masterpiece, one made by a man counting down his own years as if they were rosary beads., The Irishman is long, to be sure, but it\s never less than compelling - Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, all in their mid-to-late-70s, are each carrying a lifetime of work, with practiced ease., The Irishman is cinema, of the highest order., Scorsese knows how to wield humor, humanizing details, and digressions to keep the film lively....Of course, it helps to have three of the greatest actors of our time anchoring the proceedings., Its not going to blast you through the back of the theater... Instead, its going to engender feelings of sadness and regret amid a renewed appreciation for the directors filmmaking and storytelling prowess., Scorcese has made a film brimming with quiet power and subtle tension., For all its flash-back/flash-forward tricksiness, The Irishman rarely seems disjointed or thematically fractured., A brand new classic., f there is still any doubt as to Scorseses artistry, The Irishman will put skeptics to bed. Or six feet under., Goodfellas by way of Wild Strawberries..., The Irishman isn\t a soaring achievement: It\s a deliberate, thoughtful and somewhat muted one. No matter where that traveling camera goes, it subverts our expectations at every turn. Which can sometimes feel like a drag, but also exactly right., This opera seria about decay is handled with utmost brio, vivified by the signature élan of one of American cinemas most enduring big-canvas filmmakers."
 Jojo Rabbit ,1,"Taika Waititis comedy about a budding young Nazi exhausts its satire early..., Combining a tragedy of this proportion with humor, even if it is satirical, is a precarious tightrope walk that director Taika Waititi performs with panache., Taika Waititis film is tender, daring, and sharp -- precisely pitched so that it keeps its path steady and its ambitions in check., I suspect the strangely good-natured feel of the film will win the hearts of many viewers, but my own head remained too muddled by its uneven and oddly indecisive approach to embrace whatever quirky virtues it may possess., The tonal shifts in Jojo Rabbit dont work because theyre not seriously intended, the intention here being instead to remain consistently cute., Taika Waititis most daring film isnt his most successful. But among the tonal clashes theres real hope, humanity, and no-bones-about-it Nazi-bashing at a time when thats depressingly necessary., Its a breathtaking watch as you wonder how far Waititi will take the comedy and still keep us with him., Waititis satirical comedy manages to be one of the most thought-provoking and disarmingly tender films made on the subject., Jojo Rabbit is many things, well-intentioned among them. Brilliant it is not., Jojo Rabbit is bold in its inversion of expectations and its reimagining of a familiar subject. Theres nothing trivial about it., And at a time when racism is once again rearing its ugly head in many parts of the world, Jojo Rabbit might, with all its faults, be just the film we need right now., While Jojo Rabbit is a charming and entertaining film good for many laughs, its main problem is that its two movies., A pointless Hitler-spoofy YA adventure with a 12A certificate, obtusely accentuating little-kid cuteness and optimism amid the quaintly imagined non-horror., A staggeringly ill-conceived satire that completely fails to explore its own premise., Risky and original, youve never seen a film like Jojo Rabbit., It\s an uneasy balance between Jojo Rabbit\s Look at these idiots mentality and the film\s more conventional Learn to love each other arc., The acting is universally spectacular, both Davis and especially McKenzie making an indelible impression., Jojo Rabbit is a smart, accessible, inclusive film that opens doors at a time when many are slamming them shut. It\s a celebration of the gift of life that\s inviting you to dance with it. So dance with it., The ingredients are appetizing but the final mixture curdles., Theres a deep and sincere sweetness in the work of writer-director Taika Waititi. Its a kind of relentless and innocent good cheer that persists in the face of horror - to the point where the horror is obscured, or maybe defanged."
 Joker ,1,"What the film wants to say — about mental illness or class divisions in society — is not as interesting as what it accidentally says about whiteness., Joaquin Phoenix, in another outstanding performance., Not only an intelligent throwback to the feel-bad shock cinema of the 1970s, Joker is all but unique in its social realism..., The result of these creative decisions, however, is that whatever power Joker, as a pop culture icon, might wield, Joker, as a movie, feels toothless., Joker doesnt understand its representation of violence because it doesnt know what to do with its politics, opting instead for a confused aestheticization of anarchy, all incendiary chants and masked malcontents thronging the streets., Joker is a jumble - sometimes brilliant and sometimes trite. Among its flashes of excellence is a self-serious movie that isnt nearly as deep as it thinks it is., It knew what it was doing. The performance is so intense, with just the right register for the film...hard-boiled cinema, it managed to do something new..., Is it possible, in the world of Joker, to believe in real heroism? Do the filmmakers even care about that question?, Never evolves beyond scene after scene of painful slights, degradations, and worse - empty provocations., Its hypnotic just how horrifying Arthurs existence is, just as Phoenixs performance is hypnotic as he spirals from fragile hope into increasingly outsized and confident acts of destruction., As well made as Joker is, there is little here to delight in beyond Phoenixs performance., In aping the ambition and prestige of its motley influences, Joker winds up with a bungled understanding of its own relation to violence., A movie that borders on genius-repellant, dark, terrifying, disgusting, brilliant and unforgettable., Joker suggests that mental health issues require government funding-a narrative that would actually be progressive, if the film stopped there., Joker looks set to have the last laugh., If there is a meaningful difference between performing and acting, Joaquin Phoenix surely exemplifies the former here, creepily contorting as the Clown Prince of Crime in Todd Phillips timely, toxic take on the Making of a Murdering Madman., Phillips flashes of style are all in service of a grimdark image rather than a message about the haves and have-nots, or the treatment of mental illness, or any of the other, real issues so easily within reach. Its all show, and no substance., While it succeeds in aping the superficial aspects of Martin Scorsese\s style, Joker lacks the intelligence or gravitas of Scorsese\s best work., Joker is a self-serious movie that, in spite of its lead, posits itself as revolutionary when it never hovers above bland and tasteless., A movie of a cynicism so vast and pervasive as to render the viewing experience even emptier than its slapdash aesthetic does."
 Little Women ,1,"A gorgeous and very warm film…. What makes this version impressive is that it brings a different perspective without losing the magic of the novel., Greta Gerwigs experimental take adds clarity and wisdom to character developments and relationships that make the viewing experience more rewarding., No wonder Jo and Amy in all their ambiguities are the ones who leave the strongest impression and offer Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh respectively the opportunity to invest in and dig into their characters with relish., Moments like these are reminders of the urgency of the text, and of how rewarding it can be for a contemporary audience to re-examine the classic stories we read in our childhood., This is a really thoughtful adaptation, incredibly smart and incredibly moving., Gerwig takes matters in a new direction, at once more playful and more sober, and very self-conscious., Normally Im not averse to time-shifting in movies, but in this case I found the device unhelpful. Individual scenes are superbly staged and the cast is flawless, making the film essential viewing for lovers of the book., A work of poetic smuggling: a movie made within the norms of the industry that also reflects Gerwigs own personal artistic ideas, ideals, and obsessions., Greta Gerwigs take on Louisa May Alcotts novel is intelligent and fleet, refreshing if not radical, and as organic in its feminist convictions as it is in its depiction of close-knit sororal love., Do not miss this - its wonderful., About 20 minutes in, the characters cease to be characters; they are now flesh and blood, our sisters. We feel their happiness and despond, their cold feet and warm hearts, their slights and loves. Its a masterful, passionate, all-in kind of adaptation., Greta Gerwig has an intrinsic understanding of Louisa May Alcotts story and shes retold it with great compassion., It made me laugh, cry, and feel like I was absolutely a part of the story and the characters. Gerwig has done something really fascinating. I loved it., The latest adaptation gives the March sisters more power than ever., One-hundred-and-fifty-year-old literature never felt so alive., I love that Greta Gerwig takes not only ideas from the book... Shes closing the gap between Jo March and Louisa May Alcott and showing us that these women were the same., An absolutely lovely film that will make you feel so extremely good walking out of it., Its Little Womens deep generosity that cements it as a cinematic achievement., The swings in time, admittedly, can be a tad disorienting at first, but they provide a narrative spine that brings additional resonance to a story that most people likely think they already know., It acknowledges the tradeoffs we still have to reckon with, but it celebrates them. And it brilliantly, movingly puts forth the simple, timeless notion that sisterhood is always powerful."
 Marriage Story ,1,"Its not that Marriage Story is completely disinterested in the gender dynamics at play in heterosexual relationships, and the way they reverberate in society at large. But its brief moments of commentary dont translate..., Marriage Story is so raw and emotionally burning that the experience is best savoured alone., What should feel authentic can often feel hokey, sanitized and a fairy-tale of what a divorce could look like if people just got out of their own way., Noah Baumbachs latest film portrays both sides of a messy divorce, for once., At its best, this movie is searing. It pinpoints many of the little talked-about aspects of divorce that seem the least significant but hurt the most., The movie is 136 minutes, but the recovery period is, well, at least the rest of the night., The entire cast is rock solid, with Johansson and Driver turning in two of the very best performances of their careers., From a character perspective this film is flawless., Its a triumph, a mix of pleasure and pain that cuts so deep it leaves a scar. It hurts, but it hurts so good., The keen observations and sharp wit of Marriage Story are likely to wed the audience to the film until death do us part., Johansson and Driver are remarkably, heartbreakingly good in every scene; showing their characters journeys to an unflinching camera, letting the gap between them get wider yet unable, for their sons sake, to completely walk away., By the end, youre rooting for both Charlie and Nicole, hoping they find their own happiness despite all the bad things and the pain they caused one another., ...understands all of the emotional and procedural pitfalls and pain of divorce with complexity and clarity., Its not quite as bleak as a Bergman film, although the late Swedish auteur is clearly an influence on Baumbach, as well as on Robbie Ryans austere cinematography. But it leaves similar scorch marks upon the mind and heart., You may find yourself crying for them occasionally; I did., This terrific movie, so honest, open, smart and touching, is a little gem., Im not buying every chapter of this Marriage Story, but theres enough material here to warrant a look., The best thing of all is the generousity of its spirit., Its certainly not the most fun youll ever have at the cinema - although it is witty and there are some brilliantly comic lines - but you will see something riveting, detailed, authentic and excellent., It is Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver who give the picture its weight, clarifying movingly the couples love for one another even as theyre falling apart."
 Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ,1,"If theres something potentially dangerous or reactionary about Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywoods nostalgia for a bygone era and its trickle-down frontier heroism, its a tension that Tarantino plays with thoughtfully..., Like most of Tarantinos work, Once Upon A Time in... Hollywood is eliciting very strong emotions on both sides of the spectrum., I love this movie... When director Quentin Tarantino pulls the ripcord and it goes bananas, it is just so much fun., You can feel the love of cinema in it, but I thought it was fantastically ill-disciplined and indulgent and whole blocks of DVD extras., Tarantinos most personal film, it is also the one he has hinted may be his last. If so, he will have quit while hes ahead., This is a film set in a stunningly evoked Hollywood past. It can also be read as a commentary on Hollywood present., Consummately acted by an unusually fine ensemble cast, the film will provoke and enthral, a sure indication the director has succeeded in making not only a handsome and nostalgic movie but also a challenging and subversive one., I cant say what this adds up to. I can only say I was never bored and while the ending - brace yourself - has proved divisive., A slow, indulgent ramble through a gloriously recreated past, placidly hypnotised by its own stately paced and luminous nostalgia., Its an unharmonious clash between two separate ideas: the directors personal anxieties and the real story of the end of the 1960s., Less of a plot-driven story and more of an opulent mood piece, Once Upon a Time is a love letter, an evocation of a specific time and place., Love it or loathe it, its worth appreciating how rare it now is to have an original movie produced on such a lavish scale., There seems little doubt that every detail of the tableau has been selected to give Tarantino pleasure, and we are being permitted to witness a private ritual of self-gratification, on more than one level., It is Tarantinos best, bravest and most confrontationally impudent movie since Pulp Fiction., Spellbinding., If Once Upon a Time... falls a long way short of meaningful, it still deserves credit for groping in its graceless way towards profound ideas about the restorative miracles of cinema and the consolation of lies projected at 24 frames per second., The plot is a tapestry template that drops in characters like shining beads and watches the story weave slowly around them., The portrayal of Bruce Lee and the othering of Mexicans has the appearance of Tarantino punching down for the sake of cheap humor., A bittersweet, complex, conversation-starting look back at the film business at the close of a tumultuous decade, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also works as a strong argument for why its too soon for Tarantino to pack it in., Tarantino has become such a pro at telling these big-canvas stories, you barely notice hes picked up the pace until its fully cranking."
 Nomadland ,2,"Chloe Zhaos Nomadland mimics life scrupulously..., Whats most striking about Nomadland is the almost incidental manner in which it tells its stories - eschewing strident dramatic crises or narrative lurches for something altogether more ambient., Not since Robert Redford in All Is Lost has a star performer carried an entire film through wordless looks and glances., Frances McDormand delivers a career-best turn in this gently meditative drama about the failure of the American dream., Life on the road has never been so tenderly captured, politically alive and profoundly moving., Personally, I am fine with the more sentimental moments of Nomadland. Social realism needs the space to contain multitudes and contradictions, just as life does., McDormand masters an unshowy integrity that rarely grates against her less seasoned costars., As Fern, Frances McDormand pecks at conversation like a bird, and moves like a lizard, holding still as if to conserve energy before darting off suddenly. Her bravest choice is to embody the characters passion without always rendering it palatable., Ii could not have been made anywhere but the United States. The vast expanses of the Western desert, the purple mountains chilly majesty, provide a stark, flat, unwelcoming setting for the story about retirees and other Americans living in their vans., Nomadland treats its subjects with respect and curiosity. Their misfortunes are not used to objectify or other them, as often happens in movies about an impoverished subculture., Phenomenal. A director well hear about for a while to come...a great opportunity to catch her before she makes that big leap, I think people will really enjoy it., Theres a genuine and emotional sense of presence as the viewer moves with Fern through the beautifully realized environs of Nomadland., Nomadland feels simultaneously like both a memory and a prophecy. Zhao has managed to marry these juxtaposing ideas in her film, which is the essence of bittersweet distilled into an arrow and shot straight through the heart., In the end, Nomadland delivers a liberal-libertarian longing for a vague, undefined restoration of what was., Nomadland is a chronicle of the Great Recession that plays like a quietly thoughtful, real-life Grapes of Wrath, with McDormand\s Fern as its understated Tom Joad - strong, resolute, haunting., That is the challenge of this approach: committing to the neorealist aesthetic but relying on a star to carry it., Its just so deeply felt, moving, meditative, compassionate and beautiful. Its both majestic and kind of mundane., Nomadland balances with spine-tingling grace between respect for that restlessness of spirit and longing for a society that has any notion of how to care for it., Nomadland is achingly beautiful and sad, a profound work of empathy from Zhao. Its a true elegy, a lament for the dead, a yearning for the lost., A road movie like no other, Nomadland is a modest masterpiece like no other. Beautifully unadorned and heart-in-your-mouth stirring, its leisurely yet urgent, with a singular tone that lies somewhere between elegy and hope."
 The Father ,1,"An adventure film with its heart in the modern tradition of Romanian film drama, it should appeal to a larger audience than pure art house fans."
 Judas and the Black Messiah ,1,"Gifted as Hampton was with rare oratorial skills, the film on his life also tries to spin magic with his words..., Impressive, explosive and gut-wrenching., It all adds up to a gripping drama..., This is a film made with a sense of outrage; although the events occurred so long ago, the ramifications that they led to are clearly still being felt in the US., As a political statement, Judas is powerful, a quite relevant revisiting of an American past that, as William Faulkner would have observed, isnt even past., Kaluuya is terrific.., The big picture question of the Panthers\ political aims, and what relevance they might have for today, is not so fully explored. But taken both literally and as a parable, the film says a good deal about how society forces people into roles., It ends with the terrible mess through which we are all still living. A thrilling picture. But also a sobering one., The movie is a knockout - a 40-proof tragedy., Judas and the Black Messiah is a film whose focus on racial politics and the horrors of corrupt power are no mere history lesson, but a strong, emotionally compelling tale of humanity with an urgent contemporary message., King has pulled off the near-impossible, taking a story of an anticapitalist civil rights martyr who we know will have a tragic, bloody end, and approaching it with daring and confidence., Despite impressive performances, Judas and the Black Messiah has very little to say., For a film marked by so much bloodshed and death, Judas and the Black Messiah repeatedly takes the care to avert its gaze to the survivors, understanding them as victims, too., Hampton and the Black Panther Party were always heroes to me; this is a film that does justice to their memory., Both of the main stars are significantly older than their characters, since Hampton died at the age of 21. Thats a forgivable bit of license, given the intensity and magnetism that Kaluuya brings to the secondary role., Judas and the Black Messiah cant do everything. What it accomplishes is nevertheless quite something. It is a bittersweet compliment to whats here that we end the film wishing itd done even more., Through Kings masterful storytelling and Kaluuyas and Stanfields stunning performances, viewers learn why the Black Panther Party... was subject to the most aggressive targeting by the FBI., Uneven methodology robs Judas and the Black Messiah of the propulsive energy it could have... by viewing Fred Hampton primarily through the lens of his detractors rather than his champions, hes guaranteed an uneven execution., It\s a balance reflective of King\s film overall. Judas and the Black Messiah, resurrecting a painful saga of police racial injustice, is a self-evidently timely film without stating its contemporary resonance literally., Judas and the Black Messiahis a provocative movie title and the film that bears it lives up to the expectations it generates"
 Mank ,1,"As an example of the screenwriting art, this film itself is pretty great., Mank is a love letter and a poison pen, though like much of its meticulous directors output, this film (thats not a film, though its often made to look like one) is weighed down by the burden of time., Not unlike watching Oliver Stones JFK. Its spectacular! Its a tour du force! Its counterfactual nonsense!, More than a magnificent technical achievement, Mank is hypnotically entertaining., I loved looking at it, hearing it, and the actors in it -- particularly Charles Dance... It feels like something I can study -- it just doesnt feel like something I can enjoy watching again., Finchers latest is a disappointing slice of Hollywood hooey., It wont be for everyone. But in the canon of films about film-making, there are few as textured, as committed and as suffused with real appreciation for the craft as Mank., In his gleeful curmudgeon of a film, Fincher salutes the unseen hands of masterpieces, writers with only their wordplay to take on the world - as if play had the first thing to do with it., This is masterful filmmaking about Old Hollywood that reflects on this years tangled election., Dor all its skill and scrupulousness, I found the film a strangely remote emotional experience -- a slice of black and white that never quite bursts into living color., By siding with the writer, David Fincher draws attention to the small print and, in the process, concocts a fabulous and moving yarn of his own., An astutely probing and pain-filled work of speculative historical psychology-and a vision of Hollywood politics that shines a fervent plus ça change spotlight on current events., Mank himself says it, You cannot capture a man\s entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one. And with humor and wit and sophistication and substance, that\s exactly what Mank the movie does., If you care at all about movie history and the intersection of politics, or you just want to watch a filmmaker at the top of his craft, Mank is a must-see., It expresses both appreciation for and wariness of Hollywoods allure and its ability to shape reality., Mank is a tale of triumph, the kind thats been told countless times on the silver screen, but never quite with this moving blend of realism and regret., A worthy, eminently watchable entry in the annals of Hollywood self-obsession., Although Finchers attention to detail results in a beautifully detailed and largely accurate recreation of the era, it is anything but a loving or nostalgia-tinted portrait, It is pure pleasure to see a film that respects the audience enough to take on big issues with complexity, humanity, and wit., A film at war with itself-simultaneously heartfelt and chilly; ravishing and wooden; boisterous and airless."
 Minari ,1,"Chung and his cinematographer Lachlan Milne photograph the landscape beautifully, and you see how both Jacob and David can be entranced by its vastness, even for all the trouble it causes., What makes this more than just another formulaic feelgood film is the grit with which Chung evokes the hardscrabble lives of his characters, balancing the dreamier elements of the drama with a naturalism that keeps it rooted in reality., A rare film about assimilation that can be equally cherished by both poles of the American political landscape. And everybody in between., Minari is a story of the American Dream. But Chungs brilliance is in how he adds depth and complexity to those foundational ideas - its in the spaces in between that we find love, loss, hope, and regret., Though two last-act sequences dovetail a little too neatly, the word that covers this cinematic experience is raw., It briefly drags before the closing act, but thats hardly a complaint., It is a work of extraordinary delicacy, poignancy and tenderness. Whatever else, teachings loss is entirely our gain., Sensitively written, sparse and gorgeously acted., It is a film in which the details, the childs-eye-view episodes, the calamities, the tenderly remembered touches, all sing together like a choir., Its neatness may tempt you to dismiss its heartwarming quality as the packet kind. I dont think so., A profound, detail-perfect and soulful slice of American family life, with some of the years most sincere performances to date., A moving portrayal of the pains of assimilation, bolstered by Chungs writing and direction., The beauty of Minari is in its consideration of what we choose to love, and what we choose to leave behind., Chung and his talented cast of actors refuse to reduce any of Minaris characters to mere caricatures., The pictures chief contribution, alongside some extremely subtle and acutely observed performances, is the consoling message that everyone is the same underneath. Films with that sort of one-size-fits-all sentiment tend not to linger., There is such depth, truth, and warmth to all of these people... Every choice here is beautiful and perfect., I love this beautiful movie., Another opportunity for us to see and experience someone else American Dream...an intimate story you can settle in with..., Weeks, maybe even months later, youll still be thinking about it., Minari is a gentle, lovely picture, one that acknowledges there really is no immigrant experience, beyond the pure human experience of finding yourself adjusting to a new environment."
 Promising Young Woman ,1,"The film’s take on power and trauma is deeper than the usual pop feminism., Fennell and Mulligan deliver what they promise, from the design and performances to the tension and provocation., Mulligans withering disdain is a thing of beauty., Whenever Promising Young Woman approaches challenging material, it treats it like a hot stove and snaps its hand back as if on instinct., The plot definitely has less plausible patches. Then again, because everythings so stylised, the lapses of logic dont grate. And though the upbeat ending has irked some critics, I adored it., Strong movies divide reactions. The great ones truly polarise. This is somewhere perfectly, smartly, sweetly in between., An exquisite yet troubling film... Those looking for catharsis will not find it in Promising Young Woman., Fennell cleverly mixes romantic comedy tropes with more serious issues to give us one of the most complex #MeToo narratives weve seen so far., An entertaining, imaginative exercise in creative score-settling., I was on the edge of my seat for this, and so much else. The promise of fear is fulfilled., Promising Young Woman may not always be subtle but it is extremely effective, and the result is viscerally uncomfortable viewing, especially for anyone who likes to think of themselves as a nice guy., An ambitious, original and surprisingly emotional calling card from Emerald Fennell, with a ferociously great Carey Mulligan performance and a theme that couldnt belong more to this cultural moment., Its as if the movie wants to provide the audience with the satisfaction of a successful revenge plot while robbing its main character of everything the quest for vengeance was meant to give her in the first place..., In filmmaker Emerald Fennells diabolically funny takedown of toxic masculinity, Carey Mulligan gives a dynamite performance that should make her a frontrunner in the Oscar race for Best Actress., Manipulative and nihilistic, it forces a ruthlessly honest performance from Carey Mulligan to play along with its provocative, booby-trapped plot that comes riddled with gotcha moments., This is lip-gloss misanthropy packaged as feminist manifesto, clever but not smart, cynical without being perceptive or particularly passionate. Women are angry for good reason. They also deserve better movies than this one., A smart, provocative, pitch-black dark comedy and revenge movie with an astonishingly powerful, deeply layered performance by Carey Mulligan as Cassie..., Promising Young Woman is more profoundly a devastating reflection of a woman consumed with grief., Fennell builds a backward fantasy that feels ultimately cathartic in a very real way, but where its opening tone comes across as far too light for the palpable gravity of its ending., Whatever its flaws, Promising Young Woman really goes for it, and that makes it thrilling to watch."
 Sound of Metal ,1,"A drama thats as visceral and hard-hitting as its protagonists drum solos., Marder does away with the stigma attached to disabilities, choosing to represent them as differences rather than handicaps., Simply put, you dont hear movies like this every day., A film that deserves to be seen by the widest possible audience, reminding us of cinemas unique ability to challenge, entertain, uplift and unite., Somebody, please, give Riz Ahmed a starring vehicle worthy of his talents., Ahmeds performance is a force to be reckoned with., Darius Marders film is just as much the story of an awakening - a mans learning to listen, and to value a certain kind of stillness - as it is about the surface-level crisis of being suddenly struck deaf., A beautifully argued parable about the need to go where life takes you, Darius Marders debut thrives on the soul of Riz Ahmed and the bold creativity of sound designer Nicholas Becker., Ahmeds performance clarifies the drama and delivers the meaning of Rubens final epiphany. He gives the film energy and point., A remarkably accomplished debut; expect big things from Marder., With Oscar buzz surging for Riz Ahmed, the time is now to check out his virtuoso performance as a rock drummer facing deafness in a riveting, resonant film whose thrashing power and emotional gravity exert a grip that wont let go., So much of the film rests on Ahmed selling you this mans experience with bare bones expressions. You get everything you need and then some., The film is startlingly artful for a directorial debut, and endlessly surprising., A purposefully-quiet film..., Riz Ahmed delivers one of the most complex and moving on-screen transformations of the year., What do we owe ourselves, and how do we fail ourselves? The challenges of those reckonings are the core of Sound of Metal, a film whose technical achievements mirror the quality of its emotional truths., There is a breathless sonic majesty to Darius Marders superb Sound of Metal that left me a discombobulated mess long after the drama had ended., A film that is a surprisingly hard watch, but also essential viewing...how often does a movie make your whole body feel invested, suffocated, and finally - cathartically - floating?, Ahmed simply must get an Oscar nomination. Its a beautiful tale about recovery and moving forward., The movie may be stylized, but its not ostentatious. Its universe feels lived-in and authentic..."
 The Trial of the Chicago 7 ,1,"The Trial of the Chicago 7 might be the ultimate movie about how to fight the far right -- an artistic testament to pragmatism and a cry of rage in the era of Donald Trump and Derek Chauvin., By the end, I had given myself over to the Hollywood veneer. Chicago 7 is a particularly shiny rendering of history, but Sorkin wisely places the focus on Americas failings, even as he celebrates the people striving to fix them., As with all things Sorkin, it takes liberties with the truth - this is not a film to watch in place of reading up on the history - but its a damn good supplement for that history, and taken as a comment on our modern justice system., The Trial of the Chicago 7 is both a courtroom drama for the ages and an urgent shot across the bows., If anyone was born to make a film about the infamous federal trial surrounding the protests outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention, its Aaron Sorkin., Chicago 7 is a crowdpleaser first and foremost, and in that regard it succeeds on almost every level... Just dont expect it to be as revolutionary as some of those it calls its heroes., The film is not meant to be a documentary, though, and naturally takes creative license, keeping the essence of the real life events..., The Trial of the Chicago 7 feels outright outlandish at times; more than unrealistic, it can feel as far afield from history as an episode of the Twilight Zone., Sometimes, life does art one better., The movie is effective in spite of its foibles. Its an ensemble piece that tells a complex story cleanly. And even its missteps hint as to why Sorkin chose to return to this historical moment now., The writing was a bit grandiose and self-important, a tendency that the movies writer-director, Aaron Sorkin, has turned into a style. But he structured the late 1960s story strategically, even if he decided not to worry about historical accuracy., By reshaping this charged moment culled from somewhat recent American history in his own image, Sorkin has made The Trial of the Chicago 7 about something else entirely: himself., The best possible outcome for such a high dose of Sorkin., Theres a fine line between topicality and self-aggrandizing opportunism, and for all of the talent on display, The Trial of the Chicago 7 stumbles along it with two left feet..., Sorkin has taken the most important trial of your lifetime and shoehorned it into a conventional Sorkin-esque mold, one in which complicated real-life people have become narrative conventions in a movie full of character types and glib dialogue., It may be messy, but its fleet-footed and it means well, and in the way of any good caper flick it extols the virtue of breaking the law for all the right reasons, come what may., The Trial of the Chicago 7 is a riveting movie..., Similar to Sorkins approach to Mollys Game, dialogue supersedes other modes of conveying a story. This very intellectual reinterpretation is fact-filled to the point of being dense. Yet it is emotionally charged enough to be compelling., It represents the sanctification of a time and a people whose spirit Sorkin sees as our salvation., The fall awards season roars in with this cinema powder keg. Expect Oscar to sprinkle gold dust on Aaron Sorkin and a gangbusters cast for making this recreation of a notorious 1969 trial burn with a timely relevance that singes the screen."
 CODA ,2,"Coda is a Mort (‘Middle Of Road Tearjerker’) and if that’s what you like, you will like this., The sense of calculation makes the journey feel like a lockstep march; the movie’s sense of a story that’s dictated rather than observed makes its good feelings feel bad., No theatrics, no gimmicks - just a wonderful coming-of-age gem that aims directly at the heart and hits the bullseye., If there\s a flaw to CODA - the title stems from the term child of deaf adult -- it may be that it wears its brimming heart on its sleeve to such an extent that it occasionally nears that fine line into formula., A coming-of-age story meant to move. And while the beats of the film may be predictable, its no less affecting., Ruby is an underdog worth rooting for, and Jones is terrific. Shes like a cross between the young Winona Ryder and the young Kate Winslet. The comparison flatters all three., Youll laugh, cry and all steps in between at this vital family entertainment with a title that stands for Children of Deaf Adults. Oscar winner Marlee Matlin and newcomer Emilia Jones turn this emotional powerhouse into one of the years best., Heder, who spent time on the Massachusetts coast when growing up, knows exactly how a narrative can be enriched by the colours, moods and customs of its setting. You get to know the Rossis very well, and theyre great company., Each performance breathes life and nuance into what could easily have been a misfire. Instead, the result is tremendously sweet, uproariously funny and one of the best crowd-pleasers this year., The film is a meticulously, perhaps even cynically crafted crowd-pleaser. Even those alive to its tactics might find themselves wiping away a tear or two., As effective as it is -- and it is an effective tearjerker -- it does go down the checklist of things to push your buttons on. Its almost like a really well-designed Broadway show., You will cry in the best possible ways, even though you know better. Its kind of formulaic, but its just so warm and true., This is a familiar kind of story, but it sidesteps the clichés and the formula to be something quite moving... This is a feel good movie in the best sense., As with so much in CODA, its simple - but so beautifully executed., The conflict is unique, but the dynamic is universal..., Ruby is a gifted singer...a feel-good coming-of-age comedy..., Coda is a small movie, exquisitely made. Touching, funny and stirring, it would be the kind of movie youd urge a friend to run out and see, except theyll only need to stay home and ante up to stream it on Apple TV+., The knock here isnt that its a blatantly feel-good movie... Its that its like watching several of those kinds of movies jockeying for space, and the pile-up turning into something thats too much yet not enough., There is a place for the crowd-pleaser, the tear-jerker, the movie that wants to manipulate your emotions and make you cry - particularly if it manages to bring something new to an old formula., If youre in the market for a heart-warmer, look no further."
 Belfast ,1,"Whimsical in the most imaginative sense, their conversations make it very easy to give Kenneth Branagh the benefit of the doubt. If the reality was not like this, it should have been., The film, with a soundtrack of mostly familiar but appropriate Van Morrison songs, is clearly a labour of love, and the final scenes are immensely moving., Kenneth Branaghs unabashedly feelgood memoir of growing up in Belfast as the Troubles erupted in the late 1960s suffers from a problem of perspective., I loved it., The film is manipulative, and sentimental, and it does sometimes feel derivative... But it is also sincere, affectionate, involving and presses its buttons so deftly I welled up exactly as I was supposed to. At least three times., A twinkly-eyed childhood memoir - and rigorously fashioned to be an Oscar frontrunner., A syrupy memoir offering little insight into a turbulent time., At its best, Belfast recalls Hope and Glory, John Boormans 1987 film based on its directors own Blitz-battered childhood., It lights up the dark, the way even now a fill-um can., Branaghs theatrical career has made him expert in holding and moving an audience -- and, since this is a once-in-a-lifetime project, why not give it everything and embrace full sentimentality?, Slight but winning., Possibly the most uplifting film ever made about a time of unending violence, Kenneth Branaghs Belfast comes with a bruised heart and an unquenchable spirit of optimism., ...both grand and intimate, gooey sweet and shockingly violent, life-affirming and cynical., Belfast is not just a movie photographed in black and white, but a story told that way - the Troubles as coming-of-age narrative, a thing happening in the background while a young boy reckons with bickering parents and how to talk to girls., One could fault Branagh, one supposes, for not painting a grimmer, more naturalistic portrait of his problematic birthplace, but his mission is not to recreate childhood as history, but rather as a highly selective source of ones artistic inspiration., The director had a vision, its shot well, and after a while you dont even notice its a black and white film with the way it pulls you in..., Branagh tries to pair his pint-sized protagonists moments of joy with the harsh realities of living in a society coming apart. But in its carefully choreographed nostalgia, it is all too twinkly eyed to make much of an impact., Gorgeously shot (Haris Zambarloukos) B&W footage, with exquisite lighting and ample portrait-like closeups, makes this memoir eye-catching and enchanting., Belfast is Branaghs love letter to his family, his neighborhood, a way of life that doesnt exist any longer. Its neither complex nor rigorous -- nostalgia rarely is -- but it does leave a lump in the throat., Its like Branagh is flipping through a family photo album, giving us curated glimpses of these relatives and their lives."
 Don't Look Up ,1,"Dont Look Up shows us what happens if we wait too long to interrogate our culture and ourselves, lose sight of truth, and fail to take action., Ultimately, Dont Look Up is more than just mean-spirited and smug. Its aggressively those things -- that is, until that sentimental coda., McKays movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue., Despite a to-die-for cast and a seemingly cant-miss premise, Dont Look Up is a failure on too many levels and, although the viewing numbers may satisfy Netflix, its a shock to see such a high-profile film self-destruct., Very silly, yet undeniably urgent. I loved every second., Please ignore that instruction - or else youll miss out on a so-sharp-it-hurts satire that skewers our current state of politics, technology and celebrity culture within the context of an asteroid headed to Earth, Dont Look Up is a blunt instrument in lieu of a sharp razor, and while McKay may believe that were long past subtlety, it doesnt mean that one mans wake-up-sheeple howl into the abyss is funny, or insightful, or even watchable., Don\t Look Up makes a few decent points and gets a chuckle or two, but mostly, it is leaden when it could be farcical, sluggish when it could be screwball. This end of the world comedy should have just been more fun., The premise is squandered in a slapdash, scattershot sendup that turns almost everyone into nincompoops, trivializes everything it touches, oozes with self-delight, and becomes part of the babble and yammer it portrays., The black comic aspects of this gloomy paradox are never fully realised. I kept wishing that it had fallen into the hands of Armando Iannucci (The Death of Stalin, Veep), a social satirist with all the gifts to make it work., In the end, McKay isnt doing much more in this movie than yelling at us, but then, we do deserve it., Theres nothing more excruciating than watching very famous people work entirely too hard to be funny., The Adam McKay film stays true to the writer-directors signature style. Its star-studded, and the edits often wink at the audience, but its not so fun being in on the joke this time around., Don\t Look Up is good, but it could have been so much better., As much as I have the same political inclinations as Adam McKay and these liberal movie stars, I dont think I want to watch a movie that is presenting me with all of my personal points of views... And poking at everybody else., This is a broad, crass, scattergun comedy, but one that fairly reflects the age of distraction being so grimly targeted., Dont Look Up takes aim at plenty of ills, but a smug, self-satisfied approach proves insufficient at addressing the legitimate woes at the core of this picture., An ensemble cast stacked with A-listers is no guarantee of a good time. Neither is McKays bombastic, shake-you-by-the-shoulders direction., Theres something oddly satisfying about the way McKays film lets us laugh at our own doom., The film may not be as fabulous as its star-studded cast suggests, but its still exactly what you expect it to be, and I quite like that, a slightly sly but broad satire."
 Drive My Car ,1,"Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi makes it easy to stay put. The film passes at a glide., I really appreciated this film. Its very slow moving and you have to stick with it. , The pieces Hamaguchi assembles don’t seem to add up, and yet when it’s over you may feel that the whole is much, much larger than the sum of the parts, in ways beyond the power to articulate., Hamaguchi’s film shows that it will remain beautiful, and viewers will forget that they are not in the red Saab, and instead, they’re together, watching a movie., It’s a well made, interesting film, but surely no masterpiece., It’s mysterious, impenetrable, creeping forward on many fronts like a lava flow of ideas and nuance. It’s also throat-catchingly beautiful, as sad as a funeral, and wise in a way few films ever aspire to be., The length of the film is daunting, but its also a thoroughly engrossing piece of art thats sexy and thoughtful., Here\s the best movie you never heard of, a flat-out masterpiece from Japan that\s a frontrunner to win the foreign-film Oscar and maybe pull a \Parasite and compete for Best Picture. Why not? It\s enthralling from first scene to last., Ryûsuke Hamaguchis film takes all kinds of unexpected swerves from the sparse text its adapting. But it triumphs because it understands the weight of those little details., Drive My Car viewers need to be patient, but that patience is rewarded., Over the course of just under three hours, Hamaguchi reworks and expands a Haruki Murakami short story (it first ran in The New Yorker) into an intimate epic., Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose., Drive My Car is quiet and stirring, anchored by exquisite performances byNishijima andMiura, and enriched with a sense of both longing and forward propulsion by directorHamaguchi., Its three-hour running time flashes by., Drive My Car chugs along with brilliant linearity-leaping across weeks and years to chronicle an artists struggle to turn grief into inspiration., Hamaguchi is adept in character study, his films unfolding as if they were novels, totally consuming., For a century and more, film directors have explored crosscurrents between art and life, and how one informs the other. Hamaguchi makes that exploration a fully humanized one., Drive My Car is one of 2021s best films., Its beautiful in every conceivable way., There is a deep richness to the film, especially in Yûsukes emotional journey, and Hamaguchi does an excellent job of letting his characters secrets unfold naturally."
 Dune ,1,"Denis Villeneuve’s windswept epic is engrossing enough to maintain an audience with an intermission and a running time twice its length., When the anticipation is feverish, it sets up movies to disappoint and fail. This long-awaited movie smashes those expectations., Dune is a triumph of mediocrity. What it does, it does well enough, but was it worth doing? Its a cookie-cutter movie, a restatement of every trope that now impoverishes cinema., Nowhere near as enjoyable as Villeneuves inspired Blade Runner 2049, Dune is an achievement for sure, but watching it is rather like having huge marble monoliths dropped on you for two and a half hours., I saw it Tuesday night, and I want to already see it again this weekend. To watch a two-and-a-half-hour movie like that, says something..., I really loved Dune. The action set pieces were phenomenal, but the focus was almost always on the characters., Denis Villeneuves new big-screen adaptation underlines why generations have been fascinated by the story., This visually sumptuous space opera is sure to please new audiences and Dune fans alike., I just got swallowed up by it, shall we say., With plans to continue the story into a second movie, Villeneuve starts spinning his wheels in the sand about halfway to a sandwormy destination. It is terribly disappointing., Everything about Denis Villeneuve that keeps me from loving his previous works really works here... Villeneuves chilly, inhuman quality really works here., The plot is enough for even a sandworm to digest., It was such an incredible technical achievement that I was blown away by it over and over again., Oover the course of its two hours and 35 minutes (!), the film won me over. Had part two been immediately available, I wouldve nuked another bag of popcorn, leaned back, and clicked play., Dune, the planet, suffers perpetual drought. Dune, the movie, feels waterlogged., By the time its near three-hour run-time comes to an end, and Chalamets Paul finally encounters Zendayas Chani, the story is only just beginning to get interesting., A spicy journey to an amazing future., Villeneuves Dune sensibly tackles only one manageable section of the story, avoiding the baffling narrative compressions and ellipses that blighted Lynchs version, while reining in the extravagant excesses that thwarted Jodorowsky..., The movies stripped-down material world correlates with a stripped-down emotional one-narrow, facile, and unambiguous., The movie isn\t Lawrence of Arabia in Space, but it comes pretty close, and I say that as someone who went in a doubter."
 King Richard ,1,"Brandi is a more interesting character, thanks to a superb performance from Ellis, and their scenes together are the best in the movie, although the tennis sequences are very well shot and edited., Smith is entertaining. His single-mindedness should make him a bore but he somehow retains his talent to amuse whatever else is on his mind., Featuring a towering performance from Will Smith in the title role, proving that a hero is not necessarily easy to root for., This is a dream role for Will Smith and he attacks it with gusto. Williams is a larger-than-life character who just happens to be real, and Smith embodies his underdog, combative, indefatigable spirit to perfection., King Richard has a Will Smith problem. It is obviously meant to be award catnip for Smith and a cinematic crowning for Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena. And yet Smiths starring role may be the weakest part of the film., In this compelling, well-acted but conventionally told biopic about the unconventional dad of tennis icons Serena and Venus Williams, actor Will Smith makes another convincing bid to collect some acting trophies., Smiths work here is quite effective; he expresses Williams temerity with an easygoing slyness that is seductive enough to (briefly) look past problematic questions of exploitation., Its a welcome addition to the biopic genre, buoyed by a career-defining performance from Will Smith., King Richard spotlights the work to make a dream come true...and yes, Ive seen it twice..., The conventions of the inspirational sports drama are too formidable an opponent to defeat., Smith is excellent, fully inhabiting the character in one of the only roles to date that has required him to fully shed his habitual gloss of Will Smith charm., Regardless of how much is true, how much has been softened and reshaped to suit the movies perspective, and how much is fabricated, the end result is compelling drama with top-notch performances and a feel-good denouement., Venus and Serena Williams are the names we rightly remember, but King Richard remains fixated on the male bravado that pushed for them to get their names out there in the first place., Funny and inspirational, he disappears into the role of the man obsessed with bringing his daughters to the top of their game., King Richard is driving hard to be a feel-good movie that celebrates a Black father who overcame the odds to lift his family out of poverty and guided his daughters to their full potential., Its one of those impressive fusions between actor and character, which all comes across so effortlessly onscreen, but gives King Richard the lifeblood it needs to triumph as a film., The Williams sisters saga is so improbably inspirational that watching their ascent, coupled with Smiths crackerjack performance, had me grinning the entire time. Its the most sheerly pleasurable movie Ive seen so far this year., Whatever rough edges have been sanded off the real Richard Williams in this telling, its still a hell of a story., Smiths performance here is not a full-on impersonation, as far as I can tell. Instead, he seems to have brought his own poetic physicality to the part., The movies brightest-burning idea, and it is sincerely moving, is that Richard, for his flaws, does what he does on behalf of the young Black women hes raising. This rings true in real life and in fiction."
 Licorice Pizza ,1,"... As perversely delicious as its title., Really stands up alongside (Anderson’s best work). It feels authentic for the time, and gives us a new star in Cooper Hoffman , Licorice Pizza, like Phantom Thread, is a study of magnetic human connection that isn’t necessarily good for either party — but then, magnetic human connection rarely thinks that way, or thinks at all. , It’s a joy, and the sort of film that like a great LP -- it’s named after a Californian record store -- you’ll want to play over and over., Theres a looseness  a dreaminess, an illogic  to how it all unfolds and meanders that is somehow still incredibly authentic., The two leads, musician Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman, each in their feature film debut, are remarkable., Licorice Pizza takes an arms-length embrace of nostalgia. Anderson doesnt turn a blind eye to reality-he heightens it, weighting it with meaning, reflecting the romance of hindsight and adolescent abandon., One thing I really like about this movie is the way its structured, because its meandering and its loose but all these little moments, they feel like stories and anecdotes and memories that have been told and recounted many times., Anderson and Haim, with her sharp-elbowed and funny yet soulful performance, capture the flailing, directionless condition of being a woman in her mid-20s., This is a film carried by two people whove basically never acted before, but Anderson somehow knew that they could, and neither hits a false note in over two hours. Its a star-crossed love story à la Harold and Maude minus the tragedy., This film - which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture - will command a second (and third) watch., Gary is played by Cooper Hoffman, the teenage son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and hes captivating, full of chutzpah and with such a good, imperfect, real face., Like any LP worth its salt, this is one where youll want to be dropping the needle on over and over again., The twists and turns in the script seems desultory. That is, until you realise the whole point of Licorice Pizza is to demonstrate that most heterosexual adult males suck., This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucass American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge., The fullest expression yet of a certain kind of narrative antipathy that has crept into Andersons toolkit and almost overwhelmed his last outing, the frequently dreadful Phantom Thread., One can scarcely imagine a more enjoyably chaotic way of welcoming in the new year. What a blast., Such is the energy Anderson whips up, forever sending in chaos from the edge of the frame. The result is a giddy freewheel in which scenes never end how you or the characters expect, and whats coming next is anyones guess., The things in Licorice Pizza that are so good, like the performances from Haim and Hoffman and Cooper and the period fidelity, make you wish that the entire movie was just as good., Looser and funnier than his recent efforts, sharper and more formally assured than his earliest films, this is Paul Thomas Anderson operating at full capacity. A master at work."
 Nightmare Alley ,1,"Though Nightmare Alley is too long and meandering to totally work as a cohesive film, theres no doubt it has images that will stick with you  none more so than its haunting final shot., Nightmare Alley feels gorgeously and intricately alive on the screen. Its shadows are luxuriant and deep, often threatening to swallow the characters whole, and the actors play their parts with an aplomb that rivals del Toro’s own., The genuine, pleasant surprise for me was discovering truly what an unabashed, all-out noir it was. Blanchetts character, the big scheme, the hubris and pushing the scheme too far, the fatalism., The one to see is the one from 1947., Its hard to think of a noir story that would be better suited to del Toro as a director -- the arch-fabulist who fears men more than he does monsters., From its bruised colour palette to its spiralling descent into madness and degradation, this is deliciously damnable fare, looking back through the prism of Del Toros adventurous oeuvre to the existential angst of his vampiric feature debut, Cronos., The journey taken by del Toro may be convoluted. Where he ends up, though, is a bad dream come true., An oddly literal melodrama about bad people doing very bad things, very slowly., Its impossible to tell whether del Toro is laughing up his sleeve or crossing his fingers that Blanchetts big moments will lead to another Oscar., Telling a story of alcoholism and despair, Del Toro just makes a movie, delivered in quote marks, polished to a shine. (Far too long as well.), A strangely stiff and synthetic film..., Guillermo del Toro hits us with a spectacular noir melodrama boasting gruesomely enjoyable performances and freaky twists., Del Toro employs a mixture of stylish old Hollywood sensibilities with B movie tropes to bring us an engaging and gorgeously acted psychological thriller., If theres any justice in the world Del Toro and Blanchett will team up again., A rare del Toro film thats not an outright spook show, Nightmare Alley isnt quite the filmmakers best - but its not far off, boasting an enveloping atmosphere, compelling characters, and gorgeous filmmaking., Some have complained about the expansive running time (a half hour longer than the original), but this viewer isnt one of them; a film with this much mood and atmosphere can take its time., The second half is much more enjoyable, but by the end of it, Nightmare Alley left me cold., Its too long, too uneven in some places, too slow in others, and too flawed to be a masterpiece, but even with its drawbacks I could not take my eyes off the screen., Nightmare Alley is a mesmerizing film of characters haunted by memory and regret, from Stans nightmares of his father to the longing for the past of the socialites he cons., This isnt Simon Rex in Red Rocket or Benedict Cumberbatch in The Power of the Dog. Its more Ben Platt in Dear Evan Hansen. Its a gamble that just doesnt pay off."
 The Power of the Dog ,1,"Campion’s new Western shares a visual vocabulary with Brokeback Mountain, but what looks like an unlikely love story turns out to be a tale of revenge., A brutal meditation on masculinity., Cumberbatch is the catalyst and a terrifying one, but there are layers to Phils relationship with his brother, sister-in-law, nephew, himself, and figures from the past, that Campion peels away and reveals so deliberately and subtly., While The Piano remains a haunting exploration of female desire, The Power of the Dog is a long-delayed contemplation on masculinity from the female eye, both about repression and control., Its a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading - which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying., Campion handles such psychological denseness with virtuoso control, often whittling scenes to snippets of emotion and innuendo., Were talking about this when it comes to awards season., Jane Campions eighth feature film, her first in 12 years, The Power of the Dog reconfirms the director as a powerful force in contemporary cinema., The acting is sensational and Campion caps it off with a perfectly unsettling conclusion., Overall, The Power of the Dog probably isnt as powerful or wrenching as Campion intended for it to be but it remains an unsettling piece of cinema., Trust me when I tell you, its even better the second time around...Thats when the true genius of Jane Campion shines even brighter., The Power of the Dog, Campions newest film in 12 years, is among the years best., Broken into chapters, it starts as a nicely observed period piece, darkens into a psychological drama, then becomes an exercise in dread., An exacting drama about masculinity, toxic and otherwise.... The strong performances and the striking visual style make this a potent piece of filmmaking., How do we know Benedict Cumberbatch is a serious thespian? Because we have no idea who he is offscreen. Hes just entirely the role hes playing at any given moment, and those roles change radically., Dog is not without its faults, but its power is hard to deny., The Power of the Dog builds tremendous force, gaining its momentum through the harmonious discord of its performances, the nervous rhythms of Jonny Greenwood\s score and the grandeur of its visuals., A picturesque, enthralling exploration of male ego and toxic masculinity, crafted by an extremely talented woman and offering enough nuanced bite to keep it interesting till the very end., Cumberbatch has occasionally dallied with the dark side. Not even his Dominic Cummings in Brexit, though, is as repellent as Phil Burbank., This may not sound like a particularly enjoyable experience. But thanks to the brilliance of both Campion and Cumberbatch, its exquisite agony."
 West Side Story ,1,"Steven Spielbergs take on West Side Story is his best film since Munich, and the 4K transfer is an early contender for the best-looking home video release of the year., Think about the efforts here to extend that prologue and showcase the grittiness of the streets... Neighborhoods arent neglected, they are being demolished which underscores the irony of these gangs fighting when they have so much in common., Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed., Steven Spielbergs sweeping take on the tragic Romeo and Juliette tale dazzles the senses..., West Side Storys dazzling dance routines are fit for the big screen., Everything here has been turned up to 11, and you can really feel it -- even in numbers that weve heard a thousand times before., Was anyone hankering for a new film adaptation ofWest Side Story?Did this venerable musical need refreshing? A shiny new, ethnically aware versionwill live alongside the earlier film for years to come. Only time will tell if it supplants the original, Theyve made ill-conceived additions and misguided revisions. In the process, theyve managed to subtract doubly from the original., A solidly entertaining remake peppered with a few transcendent moments, the film boasts intimacy and emotion, creating a warm sense of deja vu mitigated by the storys still-potent condemnation of bigotry and violence., Mr. Spielberg did not waste his time-or ours. The new West Side Story is simply fabulous., Resplendent entertainment and a reminder that at least some of cinemas great classics can in fact find new life in the hands of a master director who is more concerned about crafting a movie than making a blockbuster., Spielbergs West Side Story is a charismatic showcase for everything he does best on the big screen, and a genuinely thoughtful update, making gentle and incisive rearrangements to justify its brassy sashay back into cinemas., Its a classic Spielberg joint, a classic hat-tip to Hollywood, and a classic, period. If this were the only musical of the last decade, itd still make you feel like a renaissance was in full swing., Its a hell of an achievement, and the rare case where a remake feels like an act of fervent fandom., A big, cinematic film. Its West Side Story, is what it is., The reboot pulsates with life, thanks to the directors artistry and a sensational cast led by Rachel Zegler in a starmaking feature debut as Maria., Supporting characters like Chino (a layered Josh Andrés Rivera) receive more depth, adding more meat to the story., You could probably do a shot-for-shot between this and the original...all that was alive and present in that time is still very relevant today., Perhaps Why now? is the wrong question in the face of such a stirring enterprise. Better to ask: Why not?, What Mr. Spielberg\s film does best, with zest to spare, is the dancing, choreographed by Justin Peck -- the America number is a special joy, and Ariana DeBose, as Anita, is the dynamo who powers the whole show."
 Everything Everywhere All at Once ,2,"Raising an ecstatic hot dog middle finger to the negativity of modern times, “EEAAO” urges us to free our minds and accept that it’s OK to be strange., Delightfully bonkers on the surface, this inventive extravaganza from the directing team called Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) has a deep layer of family feeling and a well-earned emotional pull at the end., The most brilliantly bananas movie of 2022 absolutely lives up to its title. Michelle Yeoh kicks all types of butt as a time-travelling laundromat manager in a multiverse of madness., Exhilarating, funny and moving, their film is also messy, overstuffed and a trifle exhausting. , It’s absurd and wild and wonderful, and will probably make you cry., There are moments when the title seems too literal. Exhaustion creeps in. But successive second winds follow., The Daniels and their wow of a star Michelle Yeoh turn this visionary absurdist comedy into a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen. , The result may be a tad overlong and convolutedly overstuffed, but it made me laugh, cry and think..., Rich performances collide with big ideas, wrapped in a nuanced understanding of how we treat each other. And there are butt jokes. So many wonderful, dumb butt jokes. What more could you ask for?, I’ve rarely felt more impaled on the fence by a film, because, exactly as promised, it’s everything at once – good and not good; fresh yet still a formula; cramped, strenuous, full to the brim., While not entirely without fault, you would be pressed to find a film as brilliantly chaotic or as original as Kwan and Scheinert’s film. , I wish I liked it more., Easily one of the best comedies of the year., A great deal of energy and talent has been expended here on the idealisation of the family unit, and the quest for a United States that never existed. , A pure firework display of technical bravado, wild invention, emotional storytelling, comedic genius, action mastery and outstanding performances, Everything Everywhere All At Once is everything cinema was invented for., An all-encompassing, therapeutic Asian American film for us who build our identities around and seek to heal from cinema., The Daniels juggle silly gags and weird visuals like cackling Dadaists., There’s lots to recommend about Everything Everywhere All at Once, but the film’s frenetic busy-ness wore me down., Its a wholly original movie at a time when originality is in short supply., The film’s unadulterated silliness has an oddball appeal if you can adjust to the rate of its convolutions."
 All Quiet on the Western Front ,1,"Oscar time is ideal for catching up with Edward Berger’s ferocious anti-war epic about young German soldiers dying in WW1 trenches. The German-language film boasts a wow nine nominations, including Best Picture, and tragically its message never gets old., This new adaptation of a classic book about young German soldiers in the First World War does everything well, except keep faith with Erich Maria Remarque’s novel., Berger’s film is a powerful plea for pacifism that comes riding on a trenchant critique of the inhumanity of statecraft. One in which the enemy is not necessarily out there across the border but within., Edward Berger’s All Quiet skimps on human drama... As a result, such high-stakes moments fall flat., ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is more grisly, disturbing, and sadistic than any horror movie in 2022., Remarque wrote his novel hoping it would be the last word on war; for anyone who has never seen a war movie, maybe this should be their first., The battle scenes, spectacularly shot by English cinematographer James Friend, who worked with the director on Patrick Melrose, juxtapose the emerging industrialisation and timeless intimacy of war., A striking and harrowing portrait of the perils of nationalism, the chaos and madness of combat, and the lasting physical and psychological scars produced by both., Berger, as a filmmaker, wants to bring us “close” to war, but the horror in “All Quiet on the Western Front” is in your face and also rather tidy in its presentation. Maybe that’s why it feels numbing., It’s sensory-overload, tough-though-rewarding viewing., A film that feels both aesthetically dazzling and full of necessary truths: an antiwar drama that transcends the bombast of propaganda mostly just because its so artfully and indelibly made., Fully understanding the war -- who does? -- may not be necessary in appreciating the disturbing, moving and sometimes too-beautiful production. But that production certainly puts a Teutonic tweak on history, sometimes to outrageous effect., Even as Paul and his mates alternate between quiet moments of reflection and sudden and deadly outbursts of battle, Germany’s political and military hierarchy already knows the war has been lost., A solid, stirring new adaptation..., The magnification in scale and dexterity lends itself to showing off. Still, the movie aims to pummel you with ceaseless brutality, and it’s hard not to be rattled by that., This is a film about the boys who don’t come home, and its story proves both deeply affecting—and surprisingly timeless., For a film focused on getting the technical realities of war correct, it is Berger’s feel for and patience with the moments that these horrors disrupt... that make this portrayal so singular., Because even though this version of Quiet predictably ends as its predecessors did, the last scene still comes as a gut punch, one that reverberates with even more significance in 2022 as war once again darkens the skies over Europe., Remarkable, if harrowing, film-making., The combat sequences are as impressive as anything commercial cinema has delivered over the last decade — grubbier, nastier and noisier than those in Sam Mendes’s theatrically choreographed 1917."
 Avatar: The Way of Water ,1,"It would be missing the point to call the proceedings indulgent to the point of self-infatuation: Cameron has built a new world from the remixed bits of this one, and he seems determined that we should not simply visit Pandora, we should live in it., It’s more than you can possibly imagine. A fantasy world so vivid and real it commands your full attention for 3h 12m.  And when it’s done, you’ll still want to linger in this heightened state of make believe., We get a story this time... that part of it was great, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes, its just too long. , If you go just for the escape and spectacle, you will be in awe. , The film’s focus is split in so many directions that none of its characters feel whole, even after three full hours., James Cameron remains very much at the center of his obsession. He may not be a great artist, or a visionary, but in its look, and its feeling for family, this behemoth enterprise still has an ardent, cornball grandeur to it., Delivers on its promise of expanding the scope of Pandora., “Avatar: The Way of Water” is fully engrossing, always eye-popping and occasionally touching. Like its predecessor, it’s a movie to admire and enjoy, if not quite love., Astonishing! Enthralling! Exciting! Immersive! None of these words could sensibly be applied to the three-and-a-quarter-hour Wet Smurfahontas stodgeathon that is Avatar: The Way of Water., The movie’s bland aesthetics and banal emotions turn it into the Club Med of effects-driven extravaganzas., ...numbing, leisurely slowness..., There is a feeling, as this long entertainment that looks great but doesn’t have much to say slowly draws to a close, that part of its job is to set the scene for the Avatars to come., As a spectacle it’s astonishing. But is this even a film? It’s more like a three-hour theme park ride. Or a superior version of those show-reel display loops they use in shops like Currys to show off how good the tellies are., If Cameron truly believes in anything, it’s the power of big-screen spectacle, and more than ever he’s determined to give us the works., Perhaps in subsequent films there might also be greater attention to the script. While the new film is a successful and sometimes wondrous visual experiment, as a story, it treads in shallow waters., Avatar 2 is just stunning in the parts it skims along the water, dives deep, rolls around joyously, keeping up with the incredible creatures who live in the deep., ho doesn’t love iridescent sea creatures, fiery cinders and weapons poking into the theater through the magic of 3D? If there’s only one movie you put on pants and leave the house for, this one is it for the visuals alone. , This new Avatar filled an awe-shaped void in my heart, and for that, I thank James Cameron., You feel Camerons passion for this natural world - I say natural fully aware that this is an artificial creation that feels like it has more blood and metal than what we usually get from studio franchise fare., I was completely taken in by\xa0Avatar: The Way of Water\xa0and overwhelmed by its fluid, kinetic action scenes, eye-popping production design and propulsive storytelling. This is a movie filled with wonder, which has become a rare commodity in the age of CGI.\n"
 The Banshees of Inisherin ,1,"Martin McDonagh expertly threads humour and pathos like a master weaver who knows exactly when to change colours., The Banshees of Inisherin is not just a beautifully written screenplay. This deeply affecting, warmly humorous, beautifully acted and handsomely photographed (by Ben Davis) film is a major work and top of my list for the best film of 2022., As a comedy duo, Farrell and Gleeson are money in the bank, just as they were in McDonagh’s first feature In Bruges. As a pairing of actor and filmmaker, Farrell and McDonagh are no less in sync., Evocative cinematography and a gorgeous score make this a spellbinding men-gone-wrong fable., The film toggles masterfully between comedy and tragedy; realism and fable. It manages to be both of the moment and completely timeless., Id almost call this a horror film., Its a gut punch of a comic-drama that keeps finding new ways to land hard-hitting body blows, and its easily one of the years very best films., Condon and Keoghan give “Banshees” extra personality and verve, while Farrell and Gleeson are\xa0the two halves of its\xa0beating heart., McDonagh is a master world builder. Whether you want to live in those worlds for two hours of your only life is purely a matter of individual taste., McDonagh, Farrell, and Gleeson deliver something special, The Banshees of Inisherin unquestionably one of the year’s best films., Gleeson and Farrell revive their mesmerizing interplay, surrounded by breathtaking Irish scenery and a brilliant ensemble cast., Banshees’ dramatic resonance is a result of how deftly McDonagh delivers his characters’ virtues and vices. What’s hilarious and tragic is that both are so modest compared to the amount of anguish they cause., I think whats quite clever about the structure of the film is that McDonagh flips your allegiances in a way thats very finely balanced., Colin Farrell is a revelation in this. I think its probably his best performance ever., The word tragicomic was coined for performances, and movies, like these., “Banshees” is like a short story trying to be a novel. The extra pages get filled with the postcard views., Farrell and Gleeson are the perfect pair to give these characters the balance of humor and heartbreak., Certainly one of Farrell’s finest performances and like the film itself, his loneliness sticks in your craw like an oft-recited Irish limerick., It’s visually stunning and consistently witty while being unafraid to ask serious questions about life as it is, and should be, lived. It is proper art., Writer-director Martin McDonagh’s soulful masterpiece offers a a windswept elegy on a camaraderie that has reached its inexplicable expiration, as well as melancholic rumination on mortality."
 Elvis ,1,"It\s all very stylized and flashy and modern, self-consciously hip in a way that\s clearly been designed to speak to generations for whom Elvis Presley may not be the King of Rock \n\ Roll so much as the guy on the soundtrack to Lilo & Stitch., Elvis is hyperbolic, one-dimensional and ludicrous – but as high-excess cinematic myth-making, it’s a blast., Luhrmanns fast-cutting super-montage style overpowers the subject matter, and the result is an impressionistic, jumbled highlight reel of Presley’s many accomplishments, despite vivid recreations by actor Austin Butler as The King., Baz Luhrmann turns the life of Elvis Aaron Presley into a three-ring circus with more sensation than sense in Elvis. But it’s got a good beat and you can dance to it., Flashes of color, lightning cuts, and the camera spins and needle drops are at times overwhelming, but it’s an overall enjoyable experience that washes over you in waves of excitement., Baz Luhrmann photobombs this Elvis portrait with over-extravagant filmmaking that dwarfs the iconic rock and roller. And that ain’t easy., The most anachronistic element of Elvis is its cloying need to assure us that its hero was a good person, as if trying to preemptively counter some imagined onslaught of TikToks about why Elvis Presley is problematic. , Of the actors who have previously tried to bottle Elvis’s lightning-like magic, none has come close to the physical, emotional, electrical energy that throbs through Austin Butler’s titular performance here., It’s an epic collage of images and sensations, but it is not a movie. Yet despite a surfeit of annoying flaws, I must add that it is also an occasional whale of an extravaganza. , Luhrmanns movie achieves its goals of highlighting Elvis music while providing a capable, if imperfect, abstract of his life. For fans of the icon and his music, it hits enough sweet spots to be worthy of a theatrical viewing., Elvis is propelled forward — almost maniacally so — by Presley’s music... The relentless music makes the whole thing feel like a montage...  But it’s infectious., A wildly over-the-top and extremely entertaining biopic of Elvis Presley. , Elvis, in the epic tradition of all of Luhrmann’s work, is a brash, overwhelming experience... It’s too much. Yet if it were any less excessive, it wouldn’t be as doggedly effective as it often is., Through Luhrmann’s lens, Elvis transforms from someone striking and fresh to a relic clinging for relevancy in a changing world. Luhrmann presents the familiar narrative with enough verve to make it feel new., Baz Luhrmann brilliantly floods our senses with arresting sights and sounds., It’s clear Luhrmann is more interested in mythmaking, era-hopping, and genre-melding than he is in trying to dig all that deeply into the complex cultural, racial, and political realities of Presley’s life., I liked it, though my corneas did feel a little crunchy afterward., Swept up in the glint of the leather and the bejeweled jumpsuits, Luhrmann overlooks the messy human who hid underneath. And so, he misses out on the heart that could have made his film truly spectacular., Every surface is cleanly wiped. Every fabric seems fresh out of the box. There is no journey to Vegas. We are essentially there from the opening scene., Baz Luhrmann’s bejeweled battering ram of a biopic is all over the place, which  can be distracting, but the grit and grace of Austin Butler’s performance as The King is a thing of beauty. A star is born right here."
 The Fabelmans ,1,"Even though the film is based on Spielbergs life, it manages quite artfully to not feel too artful; it refuses to turn itself into a fable., The Fabelmans is a film that shifts something inside you.  Working through one of the most crushing events of his own life, Spielberg exhorts us to discover, yet again, the enduring magic of the movies., Possibly the most lavishly mounted home movie ever made. Appropriately enough, that is its great strength and its fatal weakness., The result is neither as sentimental nor as moving – if those adjectives can be separated – as the director’s more personal 20th century films. It does, however, feel complete in itself. Cleanly shot. Immaculately performed., The Fabelmans’ fictional parts feel just as honest and revealing; seamless syntheses of life and art. That is Spielberg’s extraordinary gift: at 76, he’s still the boy cradling an entire medium in his hands., This is a movie so masterfully made, you can glide along its surface without quite realising all it’s asking of you., Kushner and Spielberg’s ability to turn this very personal saga into a more universal story is what sets them apart from the rest. , It makes for a strangely unsatisfying movie experience, and something akin to anticipating a sumptuous and nourishing meal but being presented only with a print-out of the recipe. Some of the ingredients are nonetheless compelling... , This could have been sentimental and soggy, a magic of the movies endeavour. There is some of that, but this is more than that. It’s about family, and the complexity of family, and it’s intensely personal, moving, absorbing and full of love., An autopsy of a marriage and a homage to invention, it’s a bittersweet piece of joy., The tone gets complicated. Adolescence often is. Flippancy aside, that is the movie’s signature: the acceptance that two things can be going on at once., Spielberg has realised that fables come in all shapes and sizes. In this hilarious and heart-breaking gem, small really is beautiful., A sweet but never cloying jaunt down Mr Spielberg’s memory lane., The Fabelmans left me with a floating feeling of happiness., What a surprise to find Spielberg, the supreme sentimentalist, occupying that murky realm. We didn’t know he had it in him., There’s something disarmingly humble about The Fabelmans and the simplicity of its desire to pinpoint the ordinary roots of future greatness., An affectionate and insightful peep into the inspiration and obsessions of a young filmmaker..., It’s a beautiful, tender and emotionally complex film, one which pays tribute to Spielbergs parents but also ensures their humanity through their flaws and failings., Spielberg has packed all these things into a deceptively simple narrative which flows so smoothly that it’s easy to miss its finer points. In that sense, it crystallises his innate ability to translate the most delicate subtleties into entertainment., Looking back with adult eyes, Spielberg sees his parents with all their flaws, yet infuses the film with warmth, understanding and love."
 Top Gun: Maverick ,1,"Burnished 1980s blockbuster nostalgia as Tom Cruise and producer Jerry Bruckheimer prove they can still make ’em like they used to. Strap in for the thrillingly real aerial dog fights., ... A summer blockbuster of the old school, with rust-bucket F-14s duking it out with young pups in F-18s, all shot on celluloid rather than sketched in by computers, at the behest of a star who refuses to quit. , Brings Maverick’s story full circle in a satisfying manner that adds depth and dimension to its predecessor, but still tells a story that’s all its own., It helps that the filmmaking is pretty much impeccable, with director Joseph Kosinski providing the kind of clear, streamlined action sequences that make blockbuster spectacle feel fun instead of mandatory., Joe Kosinski matches his well-established architectural precision with suitably nostalgic but never pandering emotionality, while Cruise commands the screen in a performance that leverages his multimillion-dollar star wattage to brighten the entire film., Somehow Cruises foray back into the danger zone will be remembered more than the original, setting a new standard in the era of reboots., Tom Cruise is here to save cinema. Hes here to save America. And Im here for it., If this sounds like hokum, it is. But the storytelling too reminds you of the best version of old Hollywood, broad strokes rendered with watchmaker care., Absolutely thrilling. You truly feel like youre in the plane with Tom Cruise pulling Gs. , Maverick is truly one for the ages in its deliverance of a distilled summer blockbuster whose thrills are strong enough to inspire highs totally indistinguishable from narcotics. Beware, and welcome to the Danger Zone., All the visuals glisten, are well composed, perfectly lit and many are bigger than life due to cinematographer Claudio Miranda’s (Life of Pi) penchant for closeups., It’s the action that sells the popcorn, and this film really delivers on that front, especially when it’s time to put the impossible bombing raid into play., An eye-popping blockbuster that, for all its daft macho contrivances, still manages to take your breath away, dammit., Top Gun: Maverick is one of those rare breeds: a sequel that’s better than the original., While the new film is not as memorable, or of its moment, it’s a more coherent piece of character drawing, a more exhilarating spectacle, and, by virtue of not being made in the mid-1980s, altogether less daft., As a stand-alone blockbuster that’s just trying to suck viewers’ eyeballs out of their sockets with hellacious flight photography and thunderous sound, Maverick is just what every cineplex in the country has been crying out for., Goes with popcorn like butter... I liked it in spite of myself., Even as you see all the plot twists coming, Tom Cruises charms and the spectacular aerial action still take your breath away., The jet-fueled sequel to the 1986 flyboy classic has charisma to burn, soaring airplane indulgences and a narrative that honors the past while breaking the sound barrier as it shifts to the future., Top Gun: Maverick is a perfectly tolerable time-killer, and I enjoy popcorn as much as anyone, but I just hope these won’t be the only kinds of movies that bring audiences back to the theaters. "
 Triangle of Sadness ,1,"A scathing stab at class divides., The title doesn’t effectively sell how chaotically funny and eviscerating Ruben Ostlund’s social satire is., He makes astute observations about small social niceties, but he pushes every awkward situation to the point where viewers gasp and wince., There’s an interesting cast of mostly unknown actors (Harrelson excepted) and the film is very well staged. Maybe the Cannes accolade was a bit on the generous side, though., For Östlund, subtlety is overrated. Triangle of Sadness shows us why he has a point. It’s a spectacular demolition of modern life, a disruptor movie full of ideas and nuance, as violent in its way as a Pieter Bruegel painting., Triangle of Sadness doesn’t leave audiences with much to unpack thematically, but it’s clear-eyed and hilarious about the systems that enforce societal inequities and what might happen if they were ever to unravel., There is scarcely a gag or scenario that isn’t telegraphed and obvious, and yet it’s seemingly just as satisfied with its own cleverness as its targets are with their over-pampered, empty lives., Theres great heady stuff going on and also really weird fun in this film too. , Yes, the metaphor can seem very on-the-nose: the super rich, in this economic climate especially, are obscene and repulsive! But its a film of great subtlety (really) and benefits from multiple viewings., Swedish director Ruben Östlund takes no prisoners in his satirical approach., The relish of the attack, the invention of the imminent mortifications and the cool precision of Östlund’s filmmaking rescues Triangle of Sadness., Östlund is shooting fish in a barrel here, but if his targets are glaring, theres at least some fun to be had along the way. , One already notorious sequence aside, Triangle of Sadness feels a little like gnashing at air. , A messy satire about wealth that occasionally uses a scalpel — but more often a scattergun., Östlund needs someone like my mother in his life to tell him it’s not clever, it’s not funny, pack it in., When a director’s brand is cynicism, every choice can seem calculated for effect over meaning., Despite Ruben Östlund’s shortcomings and imprudent tropes, Triangle of Sadness is harrowing, consistently funny, and packed with surprises., An absurd, iconoclastic riot. Ruben Östlund’s point may be blunt — yep, rich people are bad — but his telling of it is hilariously, breathlessly entertaining., As was the case with The Square, Triangle of Sadness takes some time to get going and occasionally slips into pretentiousness, but on this occasion Ostlund’s screenplay is better focused., This take on Titanic by way of Das Kapital and Gilligan\s Island, which admittedly does have its pleasures, has about as much subtlety as a falling coconut."
 Women Talking ,1,"Even though it’s a Spartan approach to filmmaking, Women Talking never fails to slap you awake., Women Talking is a tough-minded yet sensitive film that could pose a bit of a challenge for some audiences., If you can go along with these broad brushstrokes and consequent holes in the plot, you’ll find high drama in Foy and Buckley’s ferociously fine performances, together with moments of wistful poetry..., It breaks free of the bleak narratives that have boxed in cinema’s rape victims over and over again. At the very least, it’s something we haven’t seen before., A tale that is at once timely and timeless., It’s heavy material, and it might have sunk the movie had Polley not buoyed it with such a knockout cast. , Quietly, confidently and without fanfare, Polley has made the first piece of great post-MeToo cinema. What it depicts, and a homogenising hashtag doesn’t, is that there is no singular response to abuse., Polley allows bursts of weirdness and humour to punctuate deliberation that, though often abstract, never becomes alienatingly cerebral. , It is compelling, gripping, powerful, as tense as a thriller. Think of it this way: it’s like Twelve Angry Men, but in this instance it’s Eight Angry Women (in a hayloft)., Polley never condescends to us by spelling it out, but the film lands both as timeless and acutely relevant in 2023., Experiment enters the mainstream to create a new feminist cinema., The film’s rather abstract conversation doesn’t convey much in the way of urgency or specificity. But there is a sustained moral seriousness in Polley’s work, a willingness to confront pain., A remarkable ensemble of performers unite for this combustible, timely chamber-piece that hails the return of Polley as an ambitious and empirical filmmaker., This has the makings of a waiting-game Western such as High Noon or Rio Bravo, as well as hints of Unforgiven... Whatever course of action is taken in Polley’s film, it will be the women who do it., The subject matter is powerful, but despite a number of fine performances, Women Talking is never quite able to find its voice., Plays like a fable... But its sharp, and its biting. , Its a film with so much depth and, of course, one of the greater casts youll see this year. , There is a lot of injustice in the world, Women Talking admits, but there are small, hopeful things we can do to make it a better place., “Women Talking” is full of phenomenal acting by a group of actors at the top of their game., To some, this may sound like the kind of verbose material more fit for a stage play than a film. But Women Talking, adapted by the writer-director Sarah Polley from Miriam Toews’s 2018 novel, is vibrant cinema."
Piranha 3D,0,"Piranha 3D is more funny than disgusting, even when screen fills with half-nude swimmers, bobbing like human dumplings in a roiling vat of borscht. This isnt just sick, its clas-sick!, For most of Piranha 3D, Aja skates along the line separating satire/camp from horror without straying into the realm of outright parody., Seen with a group of friends and in a packed theatre it is doubtful that if this is your cup of tea youre not going to walk away ecstatic afterwards., If youre looking for signs of intelligent life -- well, did you really expect to find them in a remake of a Seventies B-movie anyway?, Gratuitous in every sense of the word., This moderately entertaining popcorn thriller recaptures the B-movie spirit of such vintage schlockmeisters as Samuel Z. Arkoff and Roger Corman., Piranha 3D ends the summer on a note of shamelessly entertaining B movie bottomfeeding., Theres a degree of gruff integrity at work for at least two-thirds of Alexandre Ajas grindhouse piranhapalooza Piranha 3D., An awe-inspiring, stomach-churning journey into blood, gore, and boobs directed by one of Frances most talented horror auteurs, Alexandre Aja., Pretty limbs are torn rudely off, a girl being carried out of the water splits in two, and Lake Victoria turns blood red with the carnage., That most unlikely of remakes -- an improvement., What is disturbing is the talent and distinction of much of the cast, whose mere presence seems to signify an element of smart, self-conscious fun that the movie does not really supply., Ajas ability to spoof an easy target gives Piranha 3-D its primary thrill factor. All those scenes of wriggling naked bodies torn to shreds have obvious cathartic potential., A movie this adolescently dirty-minded could hardly pass up a chance to go to Lake Titicaca., Lacks the fear and emotion of The Hills Have Eyes, isnt half as witty as Sorority Row and almost entirely consists of the same kill over and over., Proves yet again that theres no concept so foolproof filmmakers cant screw it up., Its hard to imagine how scenes of mass dismemberment set during a wet T-shirt contest could be staged any better., Piranha 3D proves a worthy heir to its brazen exploitation-cinema forefathers., A ridiculous gore-fest that falls completely flat in terms of character, dialogue, and logic but pops off the screen in the areas in which it really counts for a movie about prehistoric man-eating fish., These bros and bimbos are jerk tartare. Go, fish, go!"
The Town ,0,"So this isnt fresh, exactly, but it is tense and exciting and well performed and you do end up caring about the people youve been manipulated into caring about. I ask you: what more could you want from a trip to the cinema?, The Town is a definite must-see., As far as a developing directing talent goes, The Town is to Ben Affleck what Pulp Fiction was to Quentin Tarantino. Its that good., In lesser hands, the central relationship might not have worked; but Affleck and Hall make it completely believable, adding to the texture of this classy thriller., Its better than a simple heist movie and less efficient than a really good one. Affleck has made it about character and place, at the expense of the heist, so its a film of mixed attractions., Affleck’s sophomore offering contains plenty of pay-offs and a slick narrative structure, easily solidifying his growing reputation as a director with the right stuff for a familiar good time., Treats its stock dynamics and themes with respectful professionalism., A brilliantly-crafted thriller thats been tailor-made for mature audiences - in the very best sense of the word., Affleck, often underrated as an actor, fits effortlessly into this milieu., A top notch action flick undone by flashes of ego., The transformation of Ben Affleck from busted A-list star to surprisingly useful journeyman director continues in The Town his follow-up to the uneven but fascinating Gone Baby Gone., The Town is that rare beast, a grown-up genre flick, chock-full of compelling character dynamics and a clutch of pitch-perfect performances., Feels all but indistinguishable from the thousands of similar films that have blazed a trail before it., This is tripe with character. You can deride the high quotient of flimflam or you can relish the pace, sense of place, and pulsing dialogue., As a director, Affleck now has two home runs in two at-bats. This is one of the best movies of the year., Afflecks overall directorial instincts are sound; breathtaking car chases and ear-rattling shoot-outs are thrillingly executed., I give tremendous props to Mr. Affleck for keeping my butt in the seat and engaged for a movie that has not one story beat that isnt visible marching up Comm Ave., Affleck has talent behind the camera, so much I cant wait to see what hes got up his sleeve next, but even with that being so his latest cinematic heist is in the end one I didnt want to remain a part of., Affleck harnesses the pulpy material with a gritty, realistic flair that keeps you enthralled right up to the bombastic finale, where the director finally loses his grip., An autopsy for The Town would list multiple causes of death."
Easy A,0,"While Easy A might not be remembered ten years from now like such films as Pretty in Pink, Pretty Woman, and Boomerang, but its still a refreshing addition to todays genre., , A high-school comedy that comes on both sassy and cute., A sparkling moral tale about a small lie that ramifies out of control., The script shrewdly boosts its IQ by working in parallels to Nathaniel Hawthornes The Scarlet Letter and piling on 80s teen movie references., Arguably the best teen comedy since Clueless, its easy to give this one an A. Well, A-., Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth., The film goes for character-based comedy rather than spiky one-liners, so its the casts warmth that cements it as a five-star movie., A cut above the usual teenage romance thanks to the potent presence of Emma Stone, a young actor who looks a bit like a youthful Myrna Loy and who has a refined sense of comic timing., As for Emma Stone, she didnt have to win me over. She conquered me from the first A., Easy A belongs in the company of Election, Heathers, and Mean Girls -- all motion pictures that have outlived their theatrical lives because they have unique voices and use them to say something., Stones charisma sells her preternaturally mature character and makes the scripts snarky, pop culture-referencing dialogue snap., Gluck and Royal do a nice job here. Theyve constructed a teenage comedy that has sass and smarts, adults sure to enjoy it just as much as their adolescent counterparts., A comedy with a mega-talented lead star and wonderful supporting actors all left adrift by a script that vacillates between satire and social commentary but never forgets to remind you that its characters are oh-so-clever., Any movie that quotes Mark Twain, excerpts John Hughes and employs a singeing British cussword normally unheard in PG-13 high school comedies - thats all right, too. More than all right. Easy A might not ace it, but it scores a solid B., An extremely witty, inventive, sweet and perceptive coming-out party for Emma Stone., Omigod, the high school film is not dead. Text it high and text it low, for it has risen from the ashes with this clever, thoughtful and funny parable., A gem of a turn by Emma Stone as high school student Olive Penderghast makes this tale of a girl, gossip and independence a smart and self-aware hoot in the tradition of the teen flicks of the 1980s., Enhanced by a wicked sense of humor, Will Glucks movie does what Hughes did best, showcasing characters with personality who make you wish you had them on speed dial., Stone shows great self-assurance and considerable comic chops in a tour-de-force that that could have seemed smarmy and/or silly in lesser hands."
The Next Three Days,0,"It would have been far more compelling with a stronger actress but, truth be told, the ending started off anti-climactic then concluded very predictable., , Even with an actor of Crowes skill, its hard to believe the mild, thoughtful John would take to the mean streets of Pittsburgh for fake IDs, blast his way into drug houses and such., Its an all-consuming task, and Crowe makes this obsessiveness plausible., This is a terrific film with a final reel guaranteed to have you digging your fingers into your armrest., Neither Crowe nor Banks matches the levels of determination and despair that Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger brought to the same roles in the original film., Unlike many regular thrillers, there is no comedy or cynicism to counterweight the absurdity, and not much actual excitement either., Good fun for the last 90 minutes. Take a sandwich for the first 40., In the third act, both Haggis and his actors kick it into high gear, leading to a breathless chase sequence, the outcome of which is unpredictable to the last moments., Hats off to Paul Haggis. Hes got to be the first person to do a Hollywood remake of a foreign movie that turns out to be MORE waffly., Okay, but it lacks conviction., Rock solid thrills and spills. Dont get comfy - this is edge-of-the-seat stuff., The Next Three Days is perfunctory fare that seems to last almost as long as its title., The Next Three Days tried my patience and drove me up a wall, and the only break I cared about was the one I was going to make for the exit as soon as it was over., In its final half-hour, all the stops are pulled. The movie is still wildly implausible but at least its hurtling forward., The movie is a caper without playfulness or wit -- its accomplished but not much fun., The Next Three Days is a popcorn thriller through and through. Unfortunately, its also painfully boring., Haggis knows that the question isnt only can he do it, but should he?, It\s laughably, eye-rollingly absurd, so you don\t watch it and wonder, Hey, why not? You endure it and wonder, So ... why did they do that?, An okay thriller with lots of smart flourishes, The Next Three Days has us hooked early on but never quite gets us in the boat"
Repo Men,0,"This was too long, mean, and gory for me, though the satirical gloss and well-executed trick ending will probably impress some., Better and smarter than you might expect., The overused homages and a tacked-on twist ending are just failed attempts to save Repo Men from its own shallow blood lust., One of the worst endings of any film, ever. Seriously. Ever., Great stuff at first, but when Law grows a conscience and goes underground with the uninsured, the narrative excitement slumps., While Forest Whitakers conflicted thug brings languid menace, theres little to up the tension. And among all the films icky incisions, theres a feeling a better film is lying on the cutting room floor., Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf., The script, ambitious and inept in similar quantities, tries to work the set-up into an allegory for cosmetic surgery, immigration and the credit-based economy, adding a dash of confusion to the general atmosphere of callousness., Theres the seed of a good idea here. But good geh-RIEF, has it been turned into an all-clucking, all-squawking turkey twizzler of Foghorn Leghorn dimensions., Unfortunately, the filmmakers treat things with such deathly seriousness the whole thing tends to drag creating an air of overly familiar boredom difficult to get past., There are plenty of moments when the appearance of a flying, green-glow Chevy Malibu would be a welcome distraction., Alternately smirking and dully disgusting., Repo Men, rough though it is, is disturbing enough, funny enough and shocking enough to work on some weird level., As a recession-era satire, Repo Men strikes a very bitter chord., Sluggishly paced, of minor consequence, and increasingly derivative in form and content., Repo Men is a film with no identity. Its a melting pot of plot points executed more effectively by more talented people without a single genuine or subtle moment., Still, despite its flaws, this ambitious parable is enjoyable, and sometimes viscerally moving., Repo Men is basically a soulless slasher flick, and one that demeans its gifted performers., At least a robotic handclap is due to director Sapochnik for working within his limitations (including obvious budgetary ones) and giving this Frankenstein beast as much forward momentum as it possesses., Repo Men is a rare film where Toronto plays itself. Its also the first Ive ever seen where a typewriter is used as a lethal weapon."
Diary of a Wimpy Kid ,0,", Conveys, in a good-humoured, sharply observed way, the small, painful cruelties and unpredictable rules of early adolescence, and it celebrates awkwardness without feeling the need to convert it into cheap triumph., The film retains much of the original humour, some of it well executed. Its reasonably faithful to the spirit of the books, probably because Kinney is the executive producer, but its by no means equal to his originals., Perceptive, funny, unusually edgy voyage into the comic travails of schoolyard politics and childhood friendship., A sappy and superficial adaptation..., One for the kids, if theyre really misbehaving., Its an interesting idea, deserving of a more interesting treatment, but this is just dopey and patronising., A plasticky and often grating family comedy..., Fun, funny and affectionate, though it packs the emotional wallop of an undernourished high school nerd., The young cast is all game, and sidekicks Robert Capron and Grayson Russell are a real hoot. Slumber party viewings are inevitable., Quite frankly this was not the movie for me, and while Im not familiar with the source material I have trouble believing the legions of pint-sized fans that adore it are going to be happy with how their favorite tomes have been adapted., Largely avoids the gimmicky saccharine aftertaste thats typical of the genre. Anyone older than the storys resident Job, however, may not find much to write home about., Too soon though -- maybe 30 minutes in -- audience laughs turn to chuckles, fading to worn smiles., Looks drab and drained of color, and cant even muster the antic buoyancy of an average episode of iCarly., The problem with Diary of a Wimpy Kid is the wimpy kid is a jerk., What sets this kid comedy apart is how well it resists the temptation to clobber the bullies and crown the underdog., What the movie gets right, sometimes in agonizing detail, are the humiliations and horrors of school..., The friendship message that comes wrapped in the world of Wimpy Kid gives the movie its centre and its heart, along with a reminder that there is no greater act of devotion than a kid who will submit himself to the cheese touch for a pal., An above-average and sometimes surprising kid movie based on the first of a popular series of cartoon books by Jeff Kinney., Kids who realize theyre fully ordinary -- that is, pretty much all of them -- will be pleased to see a world they recognize on the big screen."
Tower Heist,0,"Lets just get this off our chests right now: Tower Heist is not a great movie., This action comedys heart is in the right place, but its screenplay and direction are not., The movie moves well, had plenty of bright spots and never bores, and by the time it was over I couldnt help but smile., On the plus side, Tower Heist has a well-cast ensemble and makes great use of its mid-Manhattan location, including an incursion into the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade..., Cheerfully crappy schlock., Its kind of weird to say this but, I think Rush Hour 3 may have had more suspense, , Ive seen great caper movies, and this isnt one of them. As mainstream Hollywood studio movies go, Tower Heist isnt bad, and it will probably fulfill most audiences desire for escapist fare. But despite some good laughs..., Made me laugh and held my interest more than it should have, given how sloppy it is. Call it an acceptable bit of B-minus work from a C student., Theres certainly nothing deep about this one, but courtesy of colorful characters, solid laughs and a festive Thanksgiving backdrop, Tower Heist makes for some decent entertainment., So what if its sheer petty escapist enjoyment? Tower Heist delivers the laughs in desperate times., Alan Alda plays the billionaire, and his oleaginous smarm is so good that you almost wish Alda were starring in a hard-edged movie about Madoff instead of this goofy heist picture that takes way too long getting to the heist., This is, of course, Hollywood schlock, directed by shlock-master Brett Ratner. But its also a surprisingly effective social drama., Highly recommended if you want to watch an assortment of rich movie stars feel your pain., The latest comedy-action film from director Brad Ratner is a shaggy affair, but its intermittently inspired in its action sequences and the comic business of its sprawling cast., Between the protracted setup and the fizzled execution, however, Tower Heist finds a nice comic groove in the jobs planning stages, when Murphy finally bursts onto the scene and pings jokes off his timid counterparts., We could use a lot more Leoni (any movie could use more Leoni) and the conclusion feels awkwardly tacked on, but it is timely and fun., Tower Heist is no great shakes as art but it does contain witty moments and a fine if unlikely denouement., Theres so much wrong with Tower Heist, but director Brett Ratner and his team pull off the improbable with this comic caper that actually gets away with being entertaining -- up to a point., Tower Heist feigns being an Oceans 11 for schmucks, but plays like a retread of 48 Hours."
Shame ,0,"Follows an arc familiar from numerous other films that deal with the theme of addiction — an accelerated freefall towards rock bottom followed by self-awareness and a hint of redemption., Shame is, indeed, a perfect distillation of the suffering-guy archetype., Cleverly written and beautifully portrayed, Shame is a sensitive look at sex and addiction weve rarely seen before in film., The films numb attitude assumes that Brandons problem is beyond reach or rescue. So why are we watching, except for high-tone misery and something close to pornography?, Many may hail Shame as a voyeuristic masterpiece when in fact its an empty provocation verging on the ludicrous., It is an exercise in controlled primeval cinematic chaos, the filmmaker going places and showcasing facets of the human conditions many would run screaming in the opposite direction to get away from., The film is a raw, unsparing look at the downside of humanity., Its McQueens astonishing knack for layering thought itself into his images that really stuns, and Shame is packed with scenes which are both immaculately composed and seething with meaning., No one will fail to find, in this strange, disturbing jewel, some reflecting facet of himself or herself., With tremendous performances from Fassbender and Mulligan, and such superb technique from McQueen, this is a horrible inferno., By turns raw, elegant and uncompromising. An assured companion piece to Hunger, if not a significant progression., It reconfirms McQueen as a filmmaker with an unflinching, microscopic gaze on the world., Brave, beautifully acted and emotionally revealing - an early strong contender for the most provocative and compelling film of the year., Few filmmakers have plumbed the soul-churning depths of sexual addiction as fearlessly as British director Steve McQueen has in Shame., Fassbender performs his role of the addict with a suave attitude that doesnt make you hate the guy. At first you envy him -- by the end, you pity him., Shame is something of a dirty date that leaves you wondering what went wrong., Equally harrowing and heartrending, Shame is a film that feels akin to going into battle, and I for one didnt emerge unscathed., Fassbender is so good as a man completely lost to his baser impulses that it makes Shame worth sitting through. Enjoying? That\s a relative term. But you\ll certainly appreciate it., You dont just watch Shame: You feel it, too., A serious character study and exploration of addiction."
New Year's Eve ,0,"The movie is a serious waste of time., , To keep it short and sweet: the movie is messier than Times Square at 3 a.m. on January 1st., New Year\s Eve is a perfect example of why the adjective Hollywood is so often used as a pejorative., The only entertaining way to watch New Years Eve is as a cruel experiment in which performers stranded with absolutely no script support are forced to subsist on pure presence, which quickly becomes a blood sport in which only a few survive., Written on the level of a bad episode of The Love Boat, this is one of those concoctions that intertwines about 10 storylines and then concludes with a cherry on top., The only thing that can inspire more cynicism than a holidays coerced emotions may be a film that both exploits and celebrates said emotions., Its all perfectly pleasant and perfectly harmless and perfectly bland., So garish and manipulative that it doesnt really qualify as a film -- its a product, no more an actual movie than a Hallmark card is a piece of poetry., This New Years Eve leaves you feeling like youve got no one to kiss at midnight., Its relentlessly plastic, a mannequin parade. No one talks, thinks, or acts like this, except in movies, and you dont believe (or care about) a single solitary second of it., None of the marquee names come off particularly well here, so its more a matter of figuring out who embarrasses themselves the most., Like The Love Boat, this is stories about love featuring a lot of big stars and with depth that can only be measured with micrometers - and Sofia Vergara as Charo., Sags when it should shimmer, labors clunkily when it should glide and - most unforgivably - plops some otherwise attractive and even talented actors into roles that are completely outside their physical and psychic comfort zone., A soul-sucking monument to Hollywood greed and saccharine holiday culture., We hope that somewhere amid the streamers and popping champagne corks director Marshall is making a resolution to stop making these movies., This is one of those unusual films thats more boring than life., An even lazier, even dumber re-hash of Valentines Day - a movie that was already very lazy and dumb to begin with., What can be said about a movie that is nice and awful? That has a warm spirit and is 100 percent phony? That has all the stars in the galaxy and all the appeal of rotting fish?, The screenplay isnt written so much as assembled in carefully slotted little blocks, following the rules of a screenwriting textbook."
"Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest",0,"This authorized documentary is more of a celebration of the legendary Queens quartet than a serious exploration of their art. But considering how brilliant they were at their peak, its hard to disagree with the general sentiment., Rapaport gets at the dynamics of a group that struggles even now to get along well enough to get paid - again., Despite accusations of nearly succumbing to spotlighting beefs over beats, the film comes off as an honest representation of a great group thats not to be forgotten., A combination of timing, access, a visual aesthetic that reflects ATCQ\s Afrocentric surface philosophy (as the crew\s look is described) and, most importantly, story-conscious editing elevates the doc above the norm., Thanks to a particularly even-handed job by director Michael Rapaport, the story emerges as compelling, even for non-fans in the audience., The movie gets the beats and rhymes down pat, but the life part is a little messy. Oh well, two out of three aint bad., Theres nothing new about the bickering between lead rappers Q-Tip and Phife, or their redundant breakup-and-reunion cycle. It helps that these lyricists are our key narrators, so at least they add wit and humour to their brief history., There are scenes toward the end of the movie that hint at a fuzzier tomorrow for Tribe, but you leave appreciating the music as it was, not hoping for anything else., The emotional honesty Rapaport captures on screen comes off as real, a cut above standard-issue Behind the Music drama in terms of believability., Somewhat against the odds, Rapaport manages to parlay his access and sycophancy into the plaint of a concerned fan: Please, fellas, squash this., Even as the band implodes, Beats flows as smoothly as Q-Tip on Verses From the Abstract. It\s the tension between the group\s core members that really propels the film forward., An outstanding effort, and one of the more honest band biopics in recent years., Rapaport smartly focuses on the yin-and-yang duo of Q-Tip and Phife Dawg, the groups lead rappers, and a fascinating study in contrasts., A reminder, part Behind the Music and part something better, that even artists professing love and togetherness have a hard time keeping it going., Rapaport, a longtime Quest fan, clearly admires Tip. Hes just too forthright a storyteller to bury the tale of the quartets acrimonious unraveling., Even those who never joined the cult of A Tribe Called Quest will find this clear-eyed chronicle of their career irresistible., Rapaport, in his feature directorial debut, does an admirable job recounting the groups formation and dissecting its dissolution., Beats, Rhymes & Life is a must for hip-hop heads. Others will either be won over or left wondering what all the fuss is about., But unlike so many movies about the rise and fall of successful bands, this one manages to capture the thrill of discovery that A Tribe Called Quest enjoyed, at least in their early years., The film serves both as a welcome document and reminder of the group in its prime, while also creating a portrait of lives still in motion, grown men trying to move on from yet respect the work of their younger selves."
Warrior ,0,"The characters are honest and true, the fight sequences are brutal and raw, while the central themes being delivered in the denouement pack a major emotional wallop., Its three leads certainly deserve consideration for their artfulness in being able to infuse it with intimations of quality., Grainy, hand-held cinematography cant lend authenticity to the forced emotion., Carries you along despite its obvious faults and pretensions, Has to conform to the lunkhead straitjacket of the tournament format: one dufus pounding another in extreme close-up for what seems like an eternity., Hardys physicality here is something to behold: you wonder how many personal trainers he worked his way through to get those neck muscles., Sickly sentimental, but the barnstorming fight scenes will leave you counting stars., This doesnt pack a punch like The Fighter - but its still a must for grapple fans., The movie is so skillfully made, and the performances are so convincingly real (Hardy is sensational), that, as it reaches its cathartic, winning finish, it achieves a surprising compassion and honesty., Warrior ends up feeling a lot bigger than you expect it to., Its too corny to live. But the picture is a slam dunk. I mean a ground-and-pound double-leg takedown. Its really gripping., Warriors three principle characterizations are compelling - Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling, sad-eyed wreck of a dad - but not enough to mask the films lesser elements., The beats are familiar, the stakes are high, the fights are brutal, and the rewards are just., OConnor films the fight scenes, and the fight training scenes leading up to them, with the requisite oomph., For some viewers it will be a knockout, a movie that comes on strong, like Tommy … For me, it came on more like Brendan … in the end wrangling me to the ground., For all the contemporary references, its essentially a spin on the story of Cain and Abel, which may be the reason it feels timeless., Its also a fight movie that knows all the fight movie cliches and doesnt shy away from embracing them wholeheartedly. But it hits its marks and hits them well, and feels fresh even as it traffics so deeply in the familiar., Warrior is a weirdly affecting hybrid, a 100-proof melodrama thats two-thirds Sylvester Stallone and one-third Eugene ONeill. Think Rockys Long Days Journey into Night., Subtle it aint., Right up until a poorly chosen ending, I was caught up in every twist and turn."
The Big Year,0,"The movie roams through its numerous picturesque locations with a pleasant enough grace, while Frankel adds just enough idiosyncratic musical and visual quirks to keep things interesting., Its theoretically possible for laughs to be gouged out of this scenario, but you wont find them here: every move, every joke, every emotion is heaved lumberingly into place., The Big Year is as glossy and inert as Martins face, which these days seems to require more foundation than the Burj Khalifa., In some alternate universe, a much better version of The Big Year exists, one that embraces the essential, insular weirdness and romantic fanaticism of the birding community it chronicles., The result is an offence-free, mild entertainment in which everyone from cast to scriptwriter seems to be winging it., Failing even to attempt genuinely humorous gags or scenarios, and incapable of conveying the thrill of its obsessive pastime or the majesty of the animals themselves, this feel-good male weepie remains comedically and dramatically grounded., Unfortunately, these comic geniuses are kept caged by the wan script and direction. The best gag in the film is the opening title card; the best joke, a throwaway by a day player., A very mild movie, but in the nicest sense of the word., What a waste that three of our finest actors are utilized as glorified bit players in such an instantly disposable comedy., The Big Year has charms: Not a jawdropping flock of them, but a number of sweet insights and warm laughs just the same., People watching birds is a nice thing. People watching a movie about people watching birds is sort of a snore., Its charms are as small as its singing feathered friends, but theyre real enough, and gentle enough, to lift it and give it flight., ...the film itself qualifies as a rara avis: a benign, good-hearted movie about three disparate characters search for happiness. The fact that its rated PG, and yet is intended for adult audiences, should tell you something about the movies nature., It\s nice to watch a comedy that doesn\t screech or foul the nest, but The Big Year is no big deal., The Big Year has heart and sweetness to spare - but as any birder will tell you, focus and energy count, too., This movie stubbornly refuses to take flight, or generate more than a few chuckles., A genial comedy with more power under its wings than it seems. This one could have flown over the cuckoos nest, or smacked into a glass pane, but instead lands in the middle of the road where quirky and popular meet., Bird-watching - or birding, as practitioners prefer to call it - makes for a stupefyingly boring movie., The scenery and the birds (at least the less obviously CGI birds) are lovely. But the personal lives of the three men are predictable and not very compelling., This gently charming comedy about a trio of birders is based on a winning premise, likable performances and stunning natural vistas."
X-Men: First Class,0,"The acting, special effects, and writing were excellent, except possibly the two times Xavier tries to hit on women in bars by saying they have groovy mutations., First Class can safely be watched by first-timers, but old faithfuls of the franchise will get a little more, tracing the origins of their favourite characters., If you didnt see the previous movies, you may not be able to appreciate some of the subtle references, but that wont make you enjoy the movie any less. Check it out., For reasons arising from the way the X-Men film franchise has developed, this is the first Marvel movie set in the period when the characters were created, and thus able to embrace the Rat Pack cool that was part of their original charm., In truth, the film is a very conventional summer potboiler repackaged in reasonably pretty, moderately crisp wrapping paper. In short, not quite groovy enough., In some glorious zone between Mad Men and Thunderbirds comes this X-Men prequel, as kinetic as it is character-driven, and full of ridiculous retro pleasures., All of this earlier part of the film, in which the young mutants discover each other and learn to control their powers, is engaging and amusing, smartly filmed and scripted. The second half, however, outstays its welcome., Why be so harsh and long-winded about a superhero movie? Because its an ambitious superhero movie., The climax is the biggest letdown, a giant hash of crosscutting and unremarkable (in an era in which weve seen everything) CGI., As X-Men films go, this one gets the job done and is certainly better than Last Stand or Wolverine. But there are still just too darn many X-Men., Looks and feels like a very cheesy Cold War-era B movie..., Easily chimes in as the best, most engaging and visually impressive X-film so far., Its all vastly superior to Brett Ratners scorched-earth X-Men: The Last Stand, of course. But new blood and swinging Sixties milieu aside, X-Men: First Class never finds a fresh way to sell the same message weve been hearing since the first X-Men., The great strength of the X-Men series is the way it taps into the feelings of all teenagers of being mutants. It is a natural part of that time of life to feel alienated and isolated, a bit horrified with the changes they are going through., Serviceable but seems more dutiful than dynamic, and is muddled by all sorts of random false notes., Surprise, surprise, but X-Men: First Class is the first sequel (or in this case prequel) of the summer that actually, doesnt just meet expectations, but surpasses them., It uses the themes of the previous movies to build an intelligent, fast-paced, and highly entertaining prequel., This blazing pre-boot breathes new life into the sagging franchise, The film is ultimately undone by that old paradox of Hollywood movie production: If you are given enormous budget, you have to spend every penny., New decade; same ol same ol."
Winnie the Pooh ,0,", Its beautifully handled by directors Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall, everything working on the perfect childlike level that speaks directly to the youngest of children without ever once talking down to them., Winnie the Pooh generates smiles and chuckles from start to finish with its good-natured, episodic story of Pooh and friends going on a wild-goose chase to find a supposedly missing Christopher Robin..., Winnie the Pooh doesnt reinvent the wheel, just gives it an affectionate spin, and that is no more and no less than what one would hope from a family reunion., Its a pleasure to sink into an animated family movie from Disney that radiates charm with a gentleness that seems damn near revolutionary., In an era of hyperactive, overly verbal 3-D animated entertainment, I hope there is still room for a film as sweet and gentle as Winnie the Pooh. At the screening I attended it seemed like the young adults in the audience were enjoying it even..., Disney doesnt offer much here that it hasnt done as well before., This is indeed good old Pooh, nothing to fear. No space robots or serial killers have been added to the cast., One would have to have a heart of cold temperament to find much -- if anything -- wrong with the animated adventure Winnie the Pooh., An unexpected gift, an unlikely return to a magical and gentle world that belongs so firmly to the past that I would have thought the journey all but impossible., Winnie the Pooh will make big people remember their childhoods. And small people will have fun getting to know all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood., Theres no bells and whistles here, no 3-D or useless grey fluff, just Pooh as hes always been, silly and true., Clocking in at a zippy 63 minutes, the story is precisely the right length for squirmy tots and concludes before the minimal plot grows stale for adults., The 1966-1974 Winnie the Pooh shorts that used to air on Disney\s Sunday night program were thinly plotted, simply drawn and replete with silly songs and jokes for third-graders. Why mess with perfection?, It doesnt matter that the film is just for kids. When it does its job right, everyone watching it is a kid., Reassuring on such a deep level because the characters are aspects of each of us and each of their struggles and mistakes feels very true to us., The makers of Winnie the Pooh had enough material for a good 65 minutes, and so they did something unusual, practically unheard of in modern times. They made a 65-minute movie., While his movie doesnt stand a chance at the box office, Pooh succeeds by embracing much of what modern films ... have largely forgotten: old-fashioned movie pleasures., Winnie the Pooh may not be a movie that grown-ups seek out on their own, but it may make some of them jealous of the 4-year-olds who are making the noble bear\s acquaintance for the first time., Winnie the Pooh revives the charm of the original Walt Disney franchise by returning to the source -- the A.A. Milne books about Christopher Robin and his stuffed animals as they learn life lessons amidst their adventures."
Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,0,"The opening 20 minutes or so play like nothing more than a widescreen Carnival Cruise commercial, everything so glossy and superficial you can almost feel the spray tan ooze down your arm., , Flails about in search of a creative reason to exist., Ratatouille aside, our children should not be playing with disease-carrying rodents., The obvious nods to Castaway, Lost and other pop culture references are barely worth a grin., You usually have to go to an Adam Sandler movie, or the Quad Cinema, to see something as incompetently made as Alvin and the Chipmunks.\\, Chipwrecked serves up more of the derivative chaos that floats this franchise\s boat., Its an uninspired and instantly forgettable film. But it completely succeeds by its own standards: an 87-minute rainy-day distraction that will probably make a zillion dollars., Maybe for the next installment, they can go off to college and find something better to do than making these silly movies., There is chipmunk gambling. There is seductive dancing by Chipettes wearing only towels. There is a musical gag involving the lyric whip my tail back and forth., If only they were truly stranded on that desert island..., Cross is the only provider of laughs in this film, which is now just a franchise machine whose purpose is to gouge yet more cash out of the kids who liked the previous two films., Good news: The shrill CG rodents, who last infested theaters in 2009s Squeakquel, are stranded on a jungle island with little hope of survival. Bad news: Theyve brought us along., You know there is something wrong with a movie when even David Cross in a giant pelican suit isnt funny., Either the Alvin and the Chipmunks movies are getting better, or I\ve accidentally buried my brain for the winter., There\s a wilful awfulness to the script that\s occasionally quite appealing: in one scene, Alvin pledges to turn the Chipmunks\ punishment into fun-ishment., Chipwrecked is the sort of Sunday afternoon trifle that will mollify children and mortify their parents., Eighty-seven minutes, the duration of this auditory assault, would be sufficient to slaughter every brain cell and induce blithering idiocy., Largely inoffensive but equally unimaginative., The film will mostly appeal to the youngest of viewers, who probably instead should be reading a book or playing in the fresh air."
The Perks of Being a Wallflower ,0,"This is boring, and its partly that believability thing. How many alienated outsiders do you have to gather together before they become insiders? Alternatively, they are all so good-looking, smart and well-heeled, they are winners, surely., Like real teenagers, Watson and Miller convincingly move from glowing objects of desire to comic relief to deeply troubled human beings., I think for a first film this guy who wrote the book and has adapted it for the screen has done a terrific job and I really found these characters sympathetic., Even making allowances for a certain amount of Hollywood gloss, theres something wrong with a film about misfits where everyone is this good-looking and poised., Perks seems like the work of a much more experienced director, maintaining fidelity to the source material without sacrificing any cinematic qualities, triggering genuine sentimentality and nostalgia through interaction between sound and image., Chbosky directs the movie with the care and conviction of someone who knows that this is his big story being told once and for all., Sensitive teens and their older kin who pine for the 90s may want to take it for a spin on the dance floor., Regardless of the viewer\s proximity to his or her own high school experience, Perks seems to get it right, precisely because it\s not about a specific time or place., Seek out the infinitely superior The Myth of the American Sleepover for an original and moving take on similar material., The movie has its moments of soap-opera excitement, but it has all the substance of a teenage strop, and none of the energy., A perky comedy with a few high-flying perceptions, mostly licensed to Watson, who acts with the freedom of a Hogwarts escapee who has finally outrun the dogs., Teenage wallflowers, past and present alike, will feel tingles of recognition, and pure pleasure., An honest, affection-hooking, coming-of-age drama which proves that there is life beyond Hogwarts for Emma Watson., Watson holds her own with a character more annoying on paper than in reality, but its the boys who most impress ..., Its an earnest indie about a troubled teen, Charlie (Logan Lerman), and his various troubled confederates -- but it does demonstrate that Watson can stand on her own., The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Ripe dramatic material, but Chbosky surrounds his hurting characters with the cinematic equivalent of a hug circle -- which is sweet, but rather antithetical to tension-building., High school can be hell, but Stephen Chboskys engaging new film argues that anyone can get by with a little help from their friends., Somehow, these imperfections fit. Somehow, The Perks of Being a Wallflower shouldn\t be flawless., This somewhat disjointed but refreshingly earnest movie ultimately establishes itself as a charmer., This is clearly a labor of love that was nurtured and sculpted from the beginning. The result is a film that feels exhilarating, fragile, funny and real."
Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,0,"A fascinating portrait of a modern artist and activist trying to make a difference within Chinas repressive political system., The films recurring theme is of an artist on a perpetual hunt for transparency, in his country and abroad., This essential, finely honed biographical portrait is jollied along by all the ironies and complexities of modern China., Though we might wish for more insight or explanation, Klaymans film remains an incredible document of a courageous individual who the Chinese officials would prefer to make disappear., A movie that somehow mixes apprehension for Ai with a feeling of warmth and, certainly, fun., Affable and unpretentious, Ai comes across as a cagey operator whose candor is very appealing., He is heroic., Its likely to change the way you think about art and politics and the state of China today., The boundaries between performance and protest are virtuosically, vitally fuddled in this stirring documentary chronicling three years in the life of Ai Weiwei, the outspoken Chinese artist and dissident., Using archival footage dating back to Ais adventures in the New York art world in his 20s, Klayman traces his evolution as a creator and as an activist., The artist repudiated the repudiation. Art had, as art always should have, the last word., Fascinating account of Weiweis practice and politics that gives centre stage to his charismatic personality., In terms of getting his message out to a wider audience, this film simply and effectively serves as part of the cause., Klayman exploits the opportunity to follow a man at the eye of a cultural and political storm, although more detail on his creative process and private life would have welcome., Though he has paid the price, Ai is a pathfinder in this new phenomenon in tactical insurrection. Never Sorry is a new-style profile in 21st-century courage., Ai admits that he\s become a brand for liberal thinking and individualism, though that\s nothing to be ashamed of -- at this point, his Warholian talent for self-promotion may be the only thing keeping him alive., The story is enthralling, but its not over, and theres no telling where its going. Which makes what we see on screen all the more involving., A sobering, cautionary tale., One of the most engagingly powerful movies of the year almost completely on the strength of Ais rumpled charisma and the confusion it creates in the bureaucratic mindset of the Chinese Communist Party., A useful primer, though it also focuses a bit more on the activism than on the art."
Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days ,0,"What happened to madness? What happened to rebellion? Oh, whats the bloody point? Nobodys listening., Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is probably the most inoffensive kids film youre likely to see this summer. And thats a good thing., Viewers enduring early adolescence or those grappling with its psychic scars will recognize the honesty in the comic humiliation., Though often self-centered and conniving, Greg remains a likable kid, and the movie entertains by pulling off over-the-top scenarios that set up digestible life lessons for youngsters., Released right when summer starts to drag, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days at least doesnt add to the exhaustion., Rather good, skewering pre-teen anxieties with some wit and accuracy and sweetening the deal with dollops of gungy slapstick., Old-fashioned and small in scale, the movies sometimes feel like after-school specials from a bygone era, which is part of what makes them so endearing., I\d call Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days harmless if it weren\t for some totally unnecessary gay-panic jokes that could actually encourage bullying., Spending time with Kinneys characters has become an annual treat., With each movie, the franchise becomes better at milking the formula that causes 4th graders to cringe with delight., Real emotions get expressed. Real family harmony emerges., Ends the series winning streak, or at least slows it down to a panting, dog-day crawl., It all makes for goofy fun, and physical comedy that will have parents rolling their eyes., The execution isnt great. David Bowers, the director, allows too much hammy acting., ...I think its possible that all tween audiences, wimpy or not, deserve better than this., The sort of mischief that felt cutely wise-alecky up to this point often just doesnt work here., Perfectly workable popcorn entertainment for the school holidays., Its formulaic in adhering to the sitcom-style tone of the first two films., The third time might not be the charm, but this harmless family comedy proves more pleasant than its episodic 2011 installment., Undoubtedly for younger moviegoers, but, like its predecessors, the film is oozing with silly antics, charming characters and, relatable situations and emotions anyone can appreciate."
MPI Media Group,0,"Throughout it all, Markus and his son capture the poetic melancholy of a mostly rural America with an eloquence that recalls the photographs of Robert Frank., The result is a kind of homespun video scrapbook, bumpy seams and glue splotches and all; its flawed, but at least it feels handmade and human., Ultimately, Kurt Markus, whose low-key narration punctuates the journey, seems to have learned as much about himself as about his titular subject - while enjoyably enlightening viewers about both., This is a singularly amateurish and unrevealing documentary, shot on grainy Super 8 film from an all-too-respectful distance., It\s About You is an odd and touching little film. I\m glad I stuck it out., If opportunities arise to explore Mellencamps process or personality, the Markuses pass., Its About Yous sound is relatively clean and dynamic, but theres nothing remotely resembling a narrative here., Luckily, the music trumps the indifferently shot concert footage and lends shape to the evocatively lensed recording sessions in iconic locations., An amateurish travelogue that feels like a botched assignment, halfheartedly self-regarding and resentfully remote from the object of our fascination., Digs deeply into the soil of working-class American life., While there arent many films shot on Super 8 anymore, Its About You doesnt make the case that moviegoing is missing anything because of that."
The Sessions ,0,"The story isnt as provocative as it tries to be, and the contrived romance is just as frustrating to watch unfold., The Sessions could easily have slipped into schmaltz, but its an unexpectedly funny delight, thanks in part to sterling work from Helen Hunt and John Hawkes., Satisfaction guaranteed? Pretty much., Hunt is a prodigy. No other actress could have brought such easeful transparency, such a glow of givingness, such heedlessness of glamour each time she strips naked., The Sessions can be sugary, but its likable., You could maybe see it working as a play, though the tactile detail of these scenes needs close-ups on the actors faces to communicate what the transaction means to them both., Three days after viewing, the films questioning generosity and sense of perspective will still be knocking around your head., Lewin, who has fought his own lifelong polio battle, handles tricky material with a gentle, empathetic touch., Formulaic but uplifting, positive and accessible., Thanks to Lewins light but assured touch, The Sessions never wears its theological preoccupations heavily, instead allowing transcendence to creep up on the audience quietly., A very different kind of love story, breaking taboos lightly, with sensitivity and humor., Achieves its sunny disposition by pulling punches., Were you to come to The Sessions expecting a disease-of-the-week heartstring-puller, youd be completely out of luck -- fortunately., A funny, tender and mostly unsentimentalized movie about physical and emotional triumph., Importantly, the film doesnt take itself too seriously, and theres a pleasantly off-beat sense of humour behind the agony and the ecstasy of this beautiful movie., An absolute delight., Forced to do all his acting with his face, Hawkes displays the kind of camera-arresting capability that has earned others Oscar nominations., Its really a three-character comedy/drama, with the best elements of both genres., Using only his tilted head, his eyes, nose, and mouth and that quizzical voice, Hawkes brings OBrien to life., With its assertive hero and inclusive humor, The Sessions is an inspirational drama you can feel good about in the morning."
The Possession,0,"By objectifying Jews as exotic others rather than presenting them as subjects, the Raimi production eliminates the precise element that would have been most powerful for a Jewish audience., This effective little creeper is the only Judaic pastiche of The Exorcist youre likely to see this year. That alone gives it a jump on the umpteen other evil/possessed-child films that have become a seemingly monthly genre staple of late., Director Ole Bornedal doesnt add a single idea of his own., There may be need for an exorcist, but the power of Christ isnt going to compel the Jewish demon wreaking havoc in this competent but shopworn horror film., The first half of The Possession is suitably atmospheric and reasonably creepy., The film is basically a compendium of possessed-child clichs reaching back to The Exorcist., Another horror movie about a little girl possessed by a demon? Seriously?, The script, credited to Juliet Snowden and Stiles White, adheres so closely to formula that its possible to predict not only which characters will end up dead, but in what order ..., Anyone who actually believes in dybbuks and other ghoulies will find The Possession terrifying. For the rest of us, the movie is a cleverly constructed, well-paced piece of hokum., A better-than-most fright-time tale ..., Even if you resist the film\s claims of being based on one family\s actual experiences, The Possession is eerily enjoyable pulp., This is a lugubrious, lovingly crafted B movie, with more than a little 1970s flavor but no arch postmodern attitude., The obvious bid for an unwarranted sequel at the end of The Possession suggest that Raimi, once hailed for his vision, is now content to just milk his cows and count his cash., The evil spirit in The Possession should be embarrassed to call itself a demon., Danish director Ole Bornedal has made some fine films in his career. The Possession isnt one of them., The Possession is morally lazy., Rather than embellish imaginatively, screenwriter Leslie Gornstein seems to have re-watched The Exorcist, Poltergeist and The Unborn for inspiration., The Possession offers a steady stream of chuckles and a few big laughs. Unfortunately, it isnt a comedy ..., The Possession isn\t exactly The Exorcist, but Ole Bornedal\s film hits enough high notes to make it a worthwhile addition to the exorcism-film heap, somewhere in the lower middle., Slick direction and a strong central turn from Jeffrey Dean Morgan will keep you watching, if rarely from the edge of your seat."
The Conjuring,0,"The Conjurings use of tension, atmosphere, and suggestion prove that the scariest thing to an audience has nothing to do with what you see, but what you dont., Wan uses every horror cliche with blithe confidence. He knows no one is immune if the effects are sturdily built, and not too literal., The trailer for The Conjuring is scarier than most horror features of recent vintage, and the feature makes good on the promise., This one never really takes hold and goes horribly wrong about 20 minutes before the end., Every hand that reaches into a wardrobe, every nervous trip into that basement just gets on your nerves. Satan needs to get over himself., Advance word that this would be the scariest horror since Amityville proves well wide of the mark., A strong cast and an atmosphere of real dread mean that despite a catalogue of immediately recognisable ghost devices, The Conjuring amounts to more than the sum of its scary parts., Wan combines the ambiance of horrors leisure-suit heyday with the more recent brand of well-timed whats-that-in-the-mirror scares., In The Conjuring, the scary casts out the spirit of the silly, permanently, and with a vengeance., The Conjuring uses every stock scare in the horror movie playbook for a dumb, yet charmingly traditional haunted house picture that manages to feel more retro than rehashed., The film may flaunt its true-story credentials for the sake of lurid immediacy but, like the best of its variety, it has a healthy understanding of its own silliness., Wans shocks are predictable but - yikes! - are they scary., Here is a humdrum hunk of am-dram Gothic, lent prestige by a few specious avowals of its basis in a true exorcism case., Conjures up expertly timed scares and very little else., Wans film is a sturdily built supernatural chiller, with next-to-no digital effects or gore, and it delivers its scares with a breezy lack of urgency., Wan builds mounting dread with silence and suspense, lingering the camera unsettlingly long here, creaking a door there., Wan ... builds the many bumps in the night into a small Hitchcockian symphony of terror by way of long, eerie tracking shots, dramatic silences, and sudden scares that are frighteningly immersive., ...there were moments where it seemed the entire theater was holding its breath. We were united in one feeling: terror., The horror movie is artfully crafted from the first scares to the closing credits, with a bold retro vibe., This is a horror film where a pair of suddenly clapping hands gives you the heebie-jeebies, and Wan doesnt cheat with his jump scares."
A Good Day to Die Hard,0,"It makes you think that the previous movies, or the first three really great ones, were all just a fluke., The action is spectacular but its incoherently directed, so often you cant tell whos smashing what lorry/jeep/helicopter into what, let alone why., It is, for anyone who loved the original films, an abomination., John McClane is listed as the character Willis plays in this movie, but the John McClane Ive grown to love over the years is no where to be found., This is the fifth and least of the Die Hard movies., What a disappointment., Director John Moore, the anonymous hack at the helm, stages car chases and gun fights with messy imprecision., To call the film perfunctory would be to insult properly perfunctory events, such as that visit to your least-favourite uncle., When I described Sylvester Stallones Bullet to the Head as cartoonish, I hadnt seen A Good Day to Die Hard., I didnt think it was physically possible to doze off at a movie as loud as A Good Day to Die Hard, but for a few moments my mind found some distant, peaceful refuge., Its all more than a little silly, but Willis presence at least provides undercurrents of easy jocularity., For anyone who remembers the Die Hard adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience., Few fans of the series would disagree that this sclerotic fifth installment should probably be the last., This is the Magpie School of action filmmaking: Anytime things start to make so little sense that you might lose the audience, just throw something shiny up on screen to distract., Johns appeal was always his ordinariness, but director John Moore has him surviving more explosions than Wile E. Coyote, and with hardly a scratch., An explosive, high-capacity-clip letdown., I guess the people making A Good Day to Die Hard dont understand that mortality is one of John McClanes most endearing qualities. Turning him into a cyborg with a sense of self-deprecating humor makes this a low point in the series history., All Die Hard movies lack sense -- thats a given. This one lacks personality. And thats unforgivable., Unnecessary but not unwatchable, this maintains a brisk pace as it moves through the familiar action set pieces, most of them decently orchestrated., If theres something crassly opportunistic about exploiting a real life disaster on the scale of Chernobyl for cheap thrills, thats part and parcel of the films cynicism."
Before Midnight,0,"A refreshing counter-point to Hollywoods typical happily ever after stories., Unleashing a stream of feminist consciousness that is both outraged and outrageous-and cathartic because we are laughing with her, not at her-Céline emerges as a 21st-century hero and Delpy as the Carole Lombard of our time., While the film has certainly satisfied many audiences and critics across the board, I was left very cold and bewildered, questioning what I even saw., Before Midnight has all the best qualities of Sunrise and Sunset (a love of conversational dialogue, long takes that value the joy of performance and interaction, gorgeous European locations), yet it is a grander and more complicated achievement., Hawke and Delpy, who co-wrote the screenplay with Linklater, make this oscillation between badinage and feistiness, cosiness and irritability, look effortless., This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love, one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour., Hawke and Delpy emerge multi-dimensional and riddled with flaws. In a long-term relationship, you may think you know what the other is thinking, but do you ever really know?, So much better written than contemporary novels, this film is a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish. For grown-ups., As before, its often very funny, with Jesse and Celine swapping Woody Allen-esque one-liners - nicely snarky, appealingly abrasive., None of the films is faultless in itself, but, tinted with complementary tones, the complete cycle comes as close to perfection as any trilogy in cinema history., Predictably, its just as great as the first two., By the end, Before Midnight inches towards a dawn of charm. But its a troubled trip., As an organic experiment in collaboration between actors and director, it is a triumph, co-created and co-owned by Delpy, Linklater and Hawke., Hawke and Delpy, who are both credited on the script too, have never found co-stars to bounce off more nimbly or bring out richer nuances in their acting., Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying., A bit tarter than its predecessors, but not skimping on their woozy, chatty charm, this perfectly played, gently incisive film is a welcome new chapter in one of cinemas most beguiling ongoing romances., Love is messy here, life cannot be controlled, satisfaction is far from guaranteed. Romance is rocky at best. But romance still is., The dialogue is never dull or one-sided; these are intelligent, articulate people, given to debate and philosophizing., Though Before Midnight is often uncomfortable to watch, it\s never less than mesmerizing - and ultimately, a joy to walk with this prickly but fascinating couple again., Before Midnight is heartbreaking, but not because of Jesse and Celine. It\s the filmmakers\ passions that seem to have cooled."
Stoker ,0,"Thankfully, this director dislikes sentimentality. Park takes these beloved figures and unceremoniously exposes their failings., There is a freedom to his filmmaking; hes trying things, odd moods and unexpected edits and unconventional compositions. He likes to keep things popping, and you cant help but respond to the wit and playfulness of his style., Its too safe, too knotty, too wastefully handsome, too dull., Stoker trembles between the portentous and the ridiculous, and I think you know which one is going to win. The audience does make its decision: Theyve been had yet again., While one is sure Stoker will satisfy many with its haughty ambivalence about any number of social taboos, others will find Parks first English-language effort decidedly vapid..., Style doesnt just win out here, it smashes substance like a bug under a shoe., Stoker, rather improbably, manages to find the handshake place between predictable and confounding. And thats... an achievement?, Stoker is a movie about tension and inaction, about people trying to figure out whats going on in someone elses head., Works mostly as a mood piece, but what a mood it is., Stoker is a cunning exercise in transgression. But one cant help but wonder what kind of film Park might have made if hed had the full creative control to which hes accustomed in Korea., None of it is life-changing, but it is effectively eerie. Stylishly spooky, even., Stoker plays out like a Kabuki Macbeth: gallons of style slathered on a story you already know by heart., Stoker is a thriller in which the big question is not What will happen next? but rather What is going on?, It seems to be unfolding somewhere else; somewhere where it makes sense that everyone seems to be sleepwalking., Aesthetics are steering this ghostly ship, leaving narrative in the background to fend for itself. Fortunately, Park is in full command of his repertoire., Even though Park creates and sustains a mood, and shows what an athlete he is with the camera, the actors are struggling valiantly to give some emotional texture to a story that, ultimately, defeats itself., If the destination isnt what it might have been, the journey is a heck of a ride., A beautifully twisted, slow-burning psychothriller that may or may not all be taking place inside Indias head, Stoker marks South Korean cult director Chan-wook Parks inaugural English language venture., Stoker is deliciously demented, and thats a good thing., Like a taxidermied owl, Stoker is lovely to look at, but in the end it\s hard to give a hoot."
Saving Mr. Banks,0,"The movie is charming and Emma Thompson, per usual, makes for an utterly endearing misanthrope. However, I have to question the decision to gloss over Travers queer identity., It is not a taxing film. You always know where its going and, with its rather melodramatic flashbacks, there is no ambiguity as to where it is coming from, but neither matters as much as they should as there is just so much joy to be had otherwise., ... it follows the Disney modus operandi of ultimately exalting even the most unlikable characters in order to satisfy their traditional family audiences., It may be the most self-congratulatory bit of hagiography Hollywood has ever produced, and thats saying something., Saving Mr. Banks depicts cinema as a perverse nexus of capitalism and psychoanalysis., Forget super. This bighearted and intelligent drama is supercalifragili. . . .you get the idea, The whole thing leaves you with an appalling chill. It feels like a warning from Hollywood to the ambivalent creators of anything: Take the spoonful of sugar or well force-feed it to you., I thought it was quite sweet., Hanks Disney is a teddy bear; Thompsons Travers is a porcupine. They go together like apple pie and, oh, liver and onions. He lights up the charm...She refuses utterly to be charmed., Pencil Thompson in now for an Oscar nomination, and maybe a win, and prepare to leave the theater humming the iconic songs., The sap doesnt run too thick, although it does run, and the movie certainly has a patented Disney upbeat feel much of the time. Its more a spoonful of sugar than medicine for aging baby boomers souls., Smart, delightful., Saving Mr Banks is a merciless film. It hits you with every sentimental low blow it can think of. Then it pounds you again. And when youre down, it jumps on you., The movie avoids commonplace traps; it never becomes maudlin and it doesnt transform Travers into a likeable elderly lady whose heart of gold is camouflaged by crotchetiness., Beneath Banks crass self-aggrandizement lies a pretty charming portrait of two overly proud people butting creative heads. Yes, charming. Thats what Disney does, and it does it well enough to turn even this condescending pap into something palatable., Its a hogwash justification for the Disney philosophy of filmmaking, but as delivered by the consummate pro Hanks, you find yourself halfway believing it., Most people will come away from Saving Mr. Banks feeling like they just sat through a feature-length ad for the magic of Walt Disney, with P.L. Travers life tacked on as an afterthought., A good movie, buoyed by good performances from Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks and, almost as an afterthought, an especially affecting Colin Farrell., The screenplay, by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, seamlessly captures two different eras with overlapping story lines that never intrude or confuse., This film works as its own lovingly rendered story."
Baggage Claim ,0,"The film does not miss a beat with the placement of pivotal characters., Honestly, I dont know what to say about this movie, because it feels so phenomenally old-fashioned and outdated, so ridiculously conservative and undermining of female independence., An utterly anodyne romcom with nothing to surprise and less to offend., Talbert adapted his script from a novel he wrote in 2003, which you have to assume had wipe-clean pages and a squeaker hidden inside the front cover., A serious contender for the worst commercial release of 2013., Romcom fans deserve something with more heart., Patton is best at contagious bliss. She might be the best at it. When she smiles, you smile. You want her to have what she wants even when how she wants it is stupid., Baggage Claim should be left behind at the carousel., A romantic comedy so light and brainless you almost expect it to float away., Man, Baggage Claim is terrible., Nothing in this movie would actually happen, so what\s irritating is that it presents itself as a savvy, Am I right, ladies? dating commentary., Baggage Claim is so archaic in its depiction of feminine self-worth-and, frankly, so insulting-it\s amazing that it\s coming out in 2013, not 1963., A shrill, embarrassing comedy that insults the female audience for which it is intended., Paula Patton is one of those actresses who seem to light up the screen whenever they appear, but even her considerable charms cant quite make Baggage Claim tolerable., Paula Patton is too likable to take a pathetic role like this!, Paula Patton puts on the well-worn shoes of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts, ending up with a predictable vehicle perhaps best left in lost and found., It would have worked better if the silly premise had been played for farcical satire, rather than following the cookie-cutter rules of the romantic comedy playbook., Convoluted, predictable, and mostly unfunny ..., Predictability and clichs get in the way of comedy here, especially with a lead character who rarely comes across as more than blandly sweet., Baggage Claim is the lost luggage of rom-coms."
Prisoners ,0,"Guzikowskis well-honed thriller occasionally idles under Villeneuves dark character studies, but the directors powerfully imposed mood of dread elevates what might otherwise have been just a superior police procedural., An increasingly sloppy thriller, filled with obvious clues, laughable red herrings, and halfhearted shock reveals, played at a snail\s pace that lets far too much air into the narrative., This film haunted me for days and weeks after seeing it, and the feeling still lingers., Prisoners -- sometimes awkwardly, for the most part persuasively -- does a delicate balancing act between outright nightmare and naturalism., Even the most seemingly benign scenes posses a low level of fear, and the final hour is heavy enough to leave audiences shaking (and shaken)., Jackman is still in his phase of high-masculine misery... The entire performance is an exclamation point, and he swings it like a baseball bat., Its a tense and engaging thriller with some big ideas, only some of which it is able to carry., Prisoners is gripping and exceptionally well made, but I found it relentless-too bleak for my taste..., Its a veritable shoo-in for an Oscar nod this year, and one of the more disturbing films to come out of a major studio in ages., A whodunnit too classy to ignore, too crude to respect., Manages to fire the intellect and stimulate further researches into Arendts work., One of the most satisfying thrillers we have seen in quite some time., A hulking gothic whodunit which sadly falls to pieces in its final act., The cast and creators are released early for good behaviour., Prisoners is weary after ten minutes, and I suppose it has persuaded itself that its length is justified by its solemn gaze into the abyss., A certain dour realist vigour keeps the nightmare alive., In less talented hands, the story could lapse into the maudlin. But Villeneuve, director of the Oscar-nominated Incendies, seems to know just how far to go; only one moment feels less than authentic, but it would be a spoiler to mention it., A decent, cogent, greyly atmospheric thriller with something to say about War-On-Terror America., Its got lofty aspirations but it also wants to wallow in the muck - to thrill you and sicken you in equal measure while also being About Something., Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore."
Dallas Buyers Club,0,"The film fails to break the pattern of transphobic narratives in cinema, perhaps because it doesnt understand that trans people are not the same as cis gay people., Sometimes a character punches through the screen, beyond the film containing him. Matthew McConaugheys performance as an HIV-positive cowboy in Dallas Buyers Club is one of those moments., Though Jean-Marc Valles direction is sometimes indistinct, it does allow the actors to come off more inhibited in their performances and each scene is that much more authentic., Despite the cadaverous appearance of its lead actor, Dallas Buyers Club wants to be pretty, too, presenting a tidy, uplifting history of the years when unconscionable inaction and prejudice toward those with AIDS were a matter of federal policy., A powerfully moving film, and McConaugheys extraordinary physical transformation is much more than a stunt., What makes the film so special is its sense of defiance and its scabrous humour., McConaughey is so charismatic that, as a simple one-man-against-the-odds drama, Dallas Buyers Club is consistently engaging; almost, despite Woodroofs intentions, inspirational., McConaughey and Leto drill down to the roots of their characters. It calls to mind that advice for actors playing drunk: you do it like youre emphatically sober. Neither man plays the disease. They play instead the rage to live., Terrific performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto elevate this socio-medical drama out of the realms of the ordinary into something quietly remarkable., For all its occasional compromises, Dallas Buyers Club shakes off potential disease-of-the-month TV movie status and succeeds at an uncomplicated emotional level., Bravely, it offers neither a feel-good nor feel-bad payoff. However, the storys momentum fizzles out, its characters often feeling disconnected from each other and us., The performances are spectacular, McConaugheys especially, so alive in approaching death., It would be a TV problem-of-the-week movie without McConaugheys skill in combining intelligence with pizzazz., It is fantastic and Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his career. In fact, it may be the best performance of anyones career. Itll blow your tiny minds. It blew my tiny mind., A calculated prestige picture that never bothers to ask broader questions about the AIDS epidemic., Like a Gary Cooper in the era of sexual crisis, McConaughey hits a very sure stride., Get this - Matthew McConaughey is currently the most exciting acting talent at work in movies. Next up, the simple business of a Christopher Nolan., Matthew McConaugheys quest to establish himself as one of the finest, most committed actors of his generation continues apace in Jean-Marc Vallees fact-based Dallas Buyers Club., The AIDS epidemic was not a happy-ending story. But it was certainly a test of the human spirit. Ron Woodroof passed that test., Dallas Buyers Club is an indelible story about one mans unwillingness to go gently into that good night, and the personal growth he experiences along the way."
Lucy ,0,"Its a film that takes great delight in her essentially co-opting a long series of tropes and storylines typically reserved for men in stories of this type, which is an old trope in the feminist action movie wheelhouse., let it grab you by the noodle and zap you into its whacked-out vision of human existence. Youll feel much better for it, I promise., Say what you will about Lucy, which is an absurdly silly and sometimes aggressively stupid movie, but its at least interested in showing us something new., A supremely silly and pleasurable action movie., It would be overstating it to suggest that Besson is enjoying a major creative renaissance but Lucy is the best film he has made in a very long time., Lucy is a stupendously effective exercise in high-end misdirection., Besson is a keen pilferer of anything thats looked good in other peoples movies., Who remembers the last good Luc Besson movie? Time to reset that particular clock, as hes returned with a stormer., Its sputtering eccentricity is at least preferable to the flat chauvinism of so many shoot-em-ups - and its certainly Bessons most enjoyable bad movie in ages., Lucy is not about to win any prizes from Mensa ... but this isnt quite like any other blockbuster youll see this year., What begins as a thrilling pastiche of comic-book formula gets bogged down in its own scientific prattle - not that you ever stop adoring Johanssons magnificent heroine., Here, at last, is a film based on the Kantian model of transcendental idealism., Johansson, a good actress, succeeds in making this nonsense more believable than it otherwise might be., After a decade of uncertain performances in often thankless roles, Scarlett Johansson is interesting again. She seems to have found her niche in science fiction: Luc Bessons Lucy is the third film in a row - after Her and Under The Skin., No one has ever accused French action director Luc Besson of thinking too hard, and this frantic exercise in pseudoscience and goofball metaphysics is best enjoyed by following his lead., Part philosophical/scientific treatise, part action movie, a film that goes from mayhem to boredom in a heartbeat., Besson has made very, very bad films in the past, but this is the first time he has presented one so idiotic that the only way to properly convey its flaws is to enumerate them., Scarlett Johansson carries the film effortlessly, bridging Bessons narrative and logical ellipses by fully embracing his crowd-pleasing intentions and convincingly depicting Lucys psychological transformation., This movie worries that humanity is wasting its potential, which is a bizarre fear for a movie that has this many nonsensical shootouts. But thats what on Bessons mind: the Big Bang and bang-bang., In the showiest sequence, Lucys body starts exploding into bursts of confetti. Even then, Johannson holds everything together. Shes the rare actress who brings conviction and clarity to flights of fancy."
Young Ones ,0,"There hasnt been as convincing a sci-fi dustbowl story since the original Mad Max., In the hot, dry world of Jake Paltrows dystopian western, Young Ones, the characterizations are as sparse as the desert foliage., Young Ones is a futuristic look at a world with little water, but the most barren thing in this Western-sci-fi flick is the character development., Young Ones has some interesting twists but falls short as a reworking of a classic Hollywood oater., Too bland to qualify as a really notable disaster, Young Ones finds young Paltrow still trying to find his voice., No matter how grim the future may be, it deserves a better movie in the here and now., The setting is futuristic, but the themes are ancient in Young Ones, Jake Paltrow\s eccentric merger of frontier western and science-fiction gadgetry., Would that there were more beneath the surface of this strange brew, but its certainly compelling while it lasts., Young Ones is an old-fashioned, worthwhile curio with just enough gee-whiz special effects and a soul as cold and grand as Erich von Stroheims Greed, A mishmash of ideas and self-conscious execution., It avoids the typical trappings of the genre pastiche by utilizing its clear indebtedness to numerous other films as merely a starting point, rather than an end., Even grading on a curve for originality, Young Ones only halfway works. But it\s a genuinely idiosyncratic vision of near-future doom that\s never boring, with characters and images that will stick in my mind longer than many better, soberer films., Gets so bogged down in its primal tale of murder and revenge that the most intriguing elements become little more than futuristic window dressing., As bone-dry as the harsh environment where its characters live, Young Ones gives us a futuristic Western so bleak that its pitiless tone becomes downright mesmerizing."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,0,"John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley add support in this sometimes campy and shallow, sometimes solemn, but mostly absorbing interpretation of the story of Moses., Bale a brilliant thespian. However, his Moses is a sullen and aloof man who is never compelling., As a whole, Scotts version of this ancient tale feels oddly toothless -- neither religious or secular viewers will find much substance beyond the basics of the spectacle in play., Its a story that has been told and retold for thousands of years, but this po-faced, dutifully spectacular retelling barely lingers in the memory beyond the end credits., This sour Moses - whose visions come after a biff on the head - emerges as a certifiable lunatic who gets lucky with a few meteorological, geographical and zoological anomalies., Yes, there is spectacle, although the initially promising parting of the Red Sea is almost drowned by waves of climactic silliness., Its sad to say that the most interesting aspects of this film dont actually occur on the screen., Whether its Ramses losing half his army in a horrific landslide or vast, sweeping panoramas of the Pharaohs Egypt in all its blood-built glory, Exodus is an entertainment of the first order., Scott once seemed divine. Look on Exodus, ye mighty, and despair., His direction snaps to life in the big moments, which have an energy and drive missing from the rest of the movie., Exodus: Gods and Kings is spectacular., This is the first portrayal of God Ive ever encountered who looked like he could use a good spanking., Crowd-wowing CGI spectacle and the inevitable if inconsequential 3-D effects make Exodus look like pure product, without any defining vision., Exodus: Gods and Kings is as uneven as Ridley Scotts career; at times, it seems to be a journey through the directors greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out ..., Its true that some modern people still believe in the Old Testament God, but that doesnt mean it makes sense to have your Old Testament figures talk and think like modern people., Exodus: Gods and Kings updates the story of Moses in every way except the one that would actually be gutsy: race., Exodus is a movie that desperately wants to be complex and nuanced, but is terrified by the possible consequences of being complex and nuanced., The screenplay (credited to four screenwriters) is a mess, the pacing is uneven, the acting is inconsistent, and the experience as a whole is a letdown., While the pale skin tones (bronzer is selectively applied) and haphazard mix of American and British accents is distracting, it barely scratches the surface of Exoduss ungainly artificiality., Exodus is an exercise in visual trickery that reaches for nothing beyond the obvious."
Cake ,0,"It will be a pity if viewers are too put off by the subject to see Anistons bravura turn, a tour de force that also tells us something about what we can and cant accept in womens performances, our threshold for unlikability and unprettiness., You hope for the tang of lemon drizzle; what you ultimately get is Madeira, with the proverbial soggy bottom., I was in pain during this indie drama, which may explain why I enjoyed it., Aniston shows quite brilliantly the effect of the constant pain on both her characters body and her mind., If I were Jennifer Aniston, I would be fuming. And I would be wondering what exactly I had to do to get an Oscar nomination for best actress., As for Aniston, she gives an honest, well-intentioned performance, but it is marooned in an unsatisfying script whose emotional effects are unearned., Jennifer Aniston lifts an addiction drama with a committed but never showy performance. Its a pity the rest of the film cant cut as deep., A brilliant Jennifer Aniston lead performance isnt enough to save this doughy, maudlin piece of misery porn., Whether or not Aniston ever gets another role like this one, I have a hard time imagining anyone else in it -- and thats the sign of a genuine actor., The slack and purposeless direction leaves the entire cast emoting in a void., Aniston makes Cake her own movie and its structural shortcomings become of lesser focus and importance., The main attraction in Cake is Aniston..., Jennifer Aniston burrows into Claires walking-wounded gait and eclipsed mood., Cake could have used more layers., A thoughtful and frequently moving drama that insightfully illuminates what it\s like to live with illness and agony., This Cake isnt fallen. Its just a bit deflated., Worth sitting through just to watch Jennifer Aniston pull off a performance of a lifetime., Directed in moody, downbeat tones by Daniel Barnz, Cake doesnt know when to stop piling on the angst., A misguided therapy dramedy that attempts to portray pain and grief with strained whimsy., Cake is delicious stuff - low key but affecting, funny while tragic, quirky but never so bizarre it loses you."
Deliver Us from Evil ,0,"Its hard not to want to avert your eyes and that makes up, marginally, for the otherwise clichéd screenplay., This is a smart blend of cop drama, thriller and paranormal elements., The director Scott Derrickson seems uncertain as to whether he is making an exploitation pic intended to give audiences a few fairground-style thrills and frights, or a William Friedkin-style meditation on the nature of evil., Those possessed people were so really brave, having to listen to all that Jim Morrison. The awful rhymes. The wretched allusions. The horror, the horror., My faith, tested by use of the Doors as a Satanic conduit, vanished for ever the instant a possessed piano bashed out Pop Goes the Weasel., With its Stygian production design and Bovril-on-the-lens aesthetic, the film works so hard to make an ordinary Bronx day feel like hell, youll wonder whats left for the afterlife., An impressively staged climactic exorcism compensates in part for the random, far-fetched storytelling that precedes it., You\ll be jolted a couple of times, but these aren\t scares that will stay with you. How about retiring based on a true story in favour of based on a good story?, The problem here is overkill. Scarcely a moment passes without some hideous apparition, frantic action scene or deafening sound effect., These wellworn devices might have been more effective had Derrickson managed to link them to a compelling central idea., If you didnt know that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie, the boot prints on your eardrums wouldve clued you in., When will the movies obsession with this rarely performed religious practice ever wane? God only knows., Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, Paul Harris Boardman, deliver a routine procedural with unremarkable frights., Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired., Its time for Derrickson, who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose, to master a new ritual., A surprisingly strong cast and solid direction make all the malarkey in this horror flick tolerable., Unfortunately, the story, dialogue, and characters have some trouble carrying all that spiritual weight; ponderousness ensues., A pretty routine and occasionally silly demonic-possession flick, which distinguishes itself by making us wait so long for the exorcism that heads may be spinning in the audience as well., The movie is never boring. The atmosphere is decidedly unsettling and a viewer will jump a few times. Even the acting is fairly solid., Luckily for Derrickson, this devil hates light bulbs, causing Ralph to spend countless scenes wandering around in the dark waiting to be startled by a cat."
Lullaby ,0,"A raft of fine actors -- including Amy Adams, Richard Jenkins, and Downton Abbeys Jessica Brown Findlay -- are wasted in a sour, callow family drama that mistakes constant yelling for emotional tension and fortune-cookie aphorisms for wisdom., A film like Lullaby should both enlighten and inspire debate. Instead, it feels simultaneously superficial and overbearing, albeit with a few moments that do indeed resonate., The kind of manipulative, clich-infested hokum that alienates moviegoers by its insistence on hogging all the tears., With the ever-expanding number of adults able to stay alive longer because of medical advancements, quality-of-life issues are top of mind for many folks. Its the way the filmmaker makes the point that is the problem., A tortured weepie that can\t quite figure out what sort of movie it is, Lullaby wears out its welcome fairly quickly., Jennifer Hudson and Terrence Howard are wasted in tiny parts, as is Amy Adams as the lost love of the sulky rocker., The film seems endless and sentimental, and the writing is too philosophical to keep the audience awake., The movie falls flat in its attempts to show how moments of absurdity break familial tension, as Levitas interrupts every bit of weary comic relief with more histrionics., Writer/director Andrew Levitas needlessly pads this captivating theme with over-used tropes ..., Garrett Hedlunds performance throbs with an anguish thats far more honest than the sentimental euthanasia subplot at the center of the film., Rarely has the terminal seemed as interminable as it does in Lullaby, writer-director Andrew Levitass tedious saga of a family reuniting at the deathbed of their paterfamilias., An outstanding cast, a weighty subject, and the sincerest of intentions are almost enough to make up for an undercooked, stuntish, and stagey script., This feature debut deals mainly in clichs, never transforming the tough question at its center into compelling cinema., Its easy to picture the principal action staged as a more taut and powerful play."
Mr. Holmes,0,"Suspense and sleuthing are a backstory to this elegant tale of regret, rectification and humility., What a pleasure it is to be in the presence of Ian McKellen, who dominates the screen in Mr. Holmes., As someone who neither hungers for yet another incarnation of this character nor understands why anyone would, I watched in subdued bafflement., The mystery subplot lacks the ingenuity of the greatest Holmes stories, but McKellen excels, switching effortlessly between the reclusive beekeeper with a faltering memory and the elegant younger detective at the height of his powers., Its a gripping little tale, to be sure, but its more than that. Somewhere in its tangle of timelines, false starts, and red herrings is a great truth about the unsolvable mystery of the human soul., Even those whove read the book can be startled by what happens in Mr. Holmes, while theyre being moved by McKellen in a role hes come to late, but with his customary elegance., An intriguing if only semi-satisfying Sherlockian enterprise., Mr. Holmes adds another version of the beloved character to the Sherlock canon; less a mystery solved than a character explored, fascinating in many small ways thanks to superb work from McKellen., McKellen is masterful, in a multilayered tale that navigates the no mans land between memory and fiction., Its a fairly compelling tale, but the intrigue we expect of a Holmes story is conspicuously lacking, even with three different mysteries unfurling onscreen., Mr. Holmes is about how the past defines us. It is also very much about regret and trying to put things right., The films plots are soft and flimsy, and they dont mesh as gracefully as they might, but they do serve as an adequate trellis for Mr. McKellens performance, which is gratifyingly but unsurprisingly wonderful., McKellen is brilliant throughout, his piercing blue eyes revealing the gallantry of youth and the sadness of a lifes worth of memories slipping further away., There is nothing elementary about Mr. Holmes, the fascinating film that tells the true story of what happens when the world\s most famous detective goes into retirement and seclusion., Sherlock Holmes may have never really walked the earth, but Mr. Holmes humanizes him to such a degree, you walk out of the theater practically convinced youve just watched a biopic., Its a gentle examining of life near its end. And with McKellen at its center, his face as gloriously long and complex as a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle plot, its also a master class in acting., An elegant puzzler that presents the sage of Baker Street dealing with the one thing hes never had to contend with before: his own emotions., Along with all the sighs and grunts, McKellen gives Sherlock a rich inner life troubled by moral and existential doubts., A careful, deliberate exploration of a powerful personality that has to rush a bit at the end, but doesnt quite trip over itself in the process., The movie, directed by Bill Condon, provides a showcase for Mr. McKellen, who in real life is 76; watching every moment of his performance is pure pleasure."
Steve Jobs ,0,"So STEVE JOBS is more of an actors movie in which the performances outweigh every other area of the film. Which isnt a negative, but is what it is. Take that for what its worth., I know exactly who Steve Jobs, Apple CEO, is. Steve Jobs feels a revelation because it exposes Steve Jobs, the man., The Jobs here will always be Aaron Sorkin\s Jobs... who people say was nerdier and more youthfully exuberant than the fully in-control maestro depicted in the film. But Fassbender does a great job with what he\s given., A reminder of Sorkins true gifts as a dramatist; it also boasts a crackerjack ensemble cast, subtle yet substantial direction by Boyle, and a welcome explosion of exceedingly tedious biopic tropes., Fassbender, in a superb performance, portrays Jobs as a genius -- but also as a painfully flawed human being., Boyle does something surprising with Sorkins endless cascades of dialogue: He turns them into music., Sometimes Fassbenders face is rigid with tension. Elsewhere hes loosey goosey. Whats uncanny is that despite no prosthetics being used he never looks like himself., From the trademark quickfire walk-and-talk dialogue (Boyle calls it a standing-up movie) to the slick sociopolitical satire, this runs on Sorkin software., Sorkin smothers any intrigue or ambiguity and signposts every irony. What he has written is a set of instructions, not a script., It is well made, and the performances are ace, as is the dialogue, and I was kept interested, so the journey may well be worthwhile, even if the destination is not., Boyle is to be hugely congratulated for suppressing his taste for cinematic bravado and allowing the drama to play out at its own pace., Boyles real achievement is making cinema out of material that isnt even a stage play as much as very expensive radio: a battery of dialogue, unbroken by reflective pauses or even, on occasion, the actors drawing breath., A drama that is genuinely concerned with thinking and ideas relevant to the way we live now., Steve Jobs is scuppered by its repetitive nature, with Sorkins overly verbose dialogue and Boyles proclivity for on-the-nose visual statements sorely testing the patience, even if one is prepared for them., For all its relevance and grandeur, Steve Jobs is ridiculously entertaining. You might say, user-friendly., Steve Jobs is successful in conveying the excitement verging on hysteria that each new launch provoked. It deals very skilfully with the ups and downs in Jobs career -- his wilderness years after he left Apple and his glorious return., It does to the traditional biographical movie what Jobs himself did to traditional ideas about computers., As original and risk-taking as its subject, Steve Jobs will make you think differently about an American icon., Boyles film makes technology warm-blooded, and reminds us that every machine has its ghost., Kate Winslet contributes a fine performance as his battered work-wife Joanna Hoffman and, as Jobs, hateful but undeniable, Michael Fassbender is terrific, much better than as Macbeth, an Oscar-contender for sure."
"McFarland, USA",0,"What makes McFarland USA so successful, and so bracing, is the way that its protagonist becomes aware of something that is rarely broached in these sorts of narratives - his own privilege., Niki Caro uses every device at her disposal to make a rousing, feelgood movie but risks turning the film into a glorified fairytale in the process., McFarland, USA is a modern anomaly — a Kevin Costner sports movie that’s genuinely rousing. , Kiwi director Niki Caro, best known for the Maori fable Whale Rider, makes underdog stories you keep wanting to get behind, and Costners born-again-good-guy routine doesnt disappoint., You run with it, just., The kids are a likeable bunch and Costner, as ever, imbues the hooey with enough gravitas to make you care., Yes, McFarland USA has the obligatory coda where we found out how everything played out for the coach and the key members of that 1987 team. You should stick around for that., The latest in a long line of condescendingly inspirational sports movies about a catalog Caucasian who learns that people of other races are also capable of being decent., In ways large and small, McFarland USA recognizes the problems inherent in the white savior premise and does what it can to address them, to surprisingly affecting ends., Heres a movie that should be disposable at best, and racially condescending at worst, and yet it sticks with you. It comes by its emotions honestly and wins you over., One of Kevin Costners finest performance... A well-told story told that is full of heart, You fall for the kids playing the runners because Caro lets their souls come through in the bus rides and the race sequences and the shameless scenes of cabbage picking., Costner could have sailed through this film but he gives his role an ingrained orneriness and melancholy that lifts the entire enterprise., Inspiration is for sale in here. And though more than a spoonful of sugar is slathered over the fact-based script, the movie delivers as promised on the thrill of the race and the lump in the throat., Its all a bit much., Yes, it\s a bit corny and convenient at times, but there\s an admiration here for hard work, ambition and battling adversity that overrides cynicism. McFarland, USA is a good film about good people; nothing wrong with that., There are good things to say about the inspirational Disney sports film McFarland, USA, starting with its up-from-the-scrap-heap story, which happens to be true., It took a village of fine performers to depict this close-knit town. And the list is too long to give a shoutout to everyone., The actors who play the young runners are a mixed bag of Hollywood unknowns and actual McFarland locals, all of whom are engaging., McFarland USA has a distinction in that its the rare sports movie directed by a woman. Caros perspective is invaluable to the films trajectory."
Concussion ,0,"Its not particularly dramatic or even fascinating to watch., The film is never less than watchable, and thanks to the collective efforts of Smith, Morse, Baldwin and Brooks its oftentimes more than that., A crusading whistleblower movie, not too far from (though slightly inferior to) The Insider, both an actors showcase and a vehicle for creating restrained goosebumps., Told in fits and starts, the film does convey a fair bit of information, but it never clarifies what needs to be done about the continuing danger., The script also knows how to pull back when sentimentality threatens. The films salutary ending shows just how its done., Omalus dedication to his profession and his struggle to make himself heard and understood make for an inspirational story, and Landesman effectively lays out the facts and invites the audience to judge both Omalu and his opponents., Concussion takes a serious subject - brain damage caused to professional American football players, and the collusion of the medical establishment in covering it up - and renders it in full-bore, crashing-bore, Oscar-courting prestige drama mode., Smiths performance is his best in years, an oasis of intelligent calm amid writer-director Peter Landesmans soapy melodrama, characterised by James Newton Howards never knowingly understated score., The suspicion lingers that this story might have been better told in a documentary than in a dramatic feature. The film also pulls its punches at times., Smith takes on Omalus Nigerian accent and too-perfect grammar with confidence, as this man with eight university degrees and an iron respect for science finds his research being crushed by the dollar-rolling might of the NFL machine -- and even the FBI., Smiths performance is shallow, conceited and bland., A middle-of-the-road drama populated by stock characters., Smiths talent and presence holds true... familiar tale loses a bit of its dramatic punch..., The movie murmurs, when it - and others - should be shouting., After a good start, the second half tries to make a strong case for the films agenda - but what it really needs is a strong character., A melodramatic but compelling enough lab-coat drama about football players and the pathological implications of too many blows to their heads ..., Just in time for the NFL playoffs, here comes Concussion, a movie that will hopefully give many serious pause about our nation\s most popular sport., While Concussion has some fine things going for it, notably science and Will Smith, it lacks the exciting, committed filmmaking that rises to the level of its outrageous topic., Concussions dramatic core is solid and its unwillingness to sugarcoat the NFLs tactics is likely to raise some eyebrows., In football terms, its a fumble."
Spare Parts ,0,"Though based on a Wired magazine story, this sticks closely to the formulas of inspirational-teacher and sports-team dramas; distinguishing it from the pack is the fact that all four students who formed the club were undocumented., The film refreshingly portrays its kids as part of a diverse group trying to succeed in a country in which they can never find secure footing., Sequences and scenes end unceremoniously, everyone in the movie seems to know each others backstory before theyre properly introduced, and mild jokes land with uncertainty., Spare Parts tries too hard to be a based-on-a-true-story, feel-good, crowd-pleasing, triumph-of-the-underdogs movie., While the appropriately titled Spare Parts might feel like it has been assembled from bits and pieces of other inspirational movies, that doesn\t mean the fact-based drama is any less effective ..., This blatantly big-hearted product isnt half as vibrant as the original 2005 Wired article on which its based, and myopically neglects to address Arizonas troubling anti-immigration legislation through even a splash of hindsight., The fictionalized backstory for Cameron is superfluous and distracting...Still, with a storyline like this one, it cannot help being fun to watch., Despite its clunkier elements, Matsuedas screenplay is alert to details that ground the film in the day-to-day lives of young people who are American in every way but technically., In the end, Spare Parts proves to be more exhausting than it is inspiring., At times, Spare Parts sails perilously close to the saccharine. But the film is a fine example of a message movie that does justice both to its important subject matter and to its characters inner lives., A surprisingly effective and affecting fact-based drama, despite its reliance on several recycled elements., The screenplay ... plays down intellect in favor of corn and clich., Spare Parts stands and delivers on its own intriguing merits., Though based on a true story, Spare Parts, like every other studio product, rehashes clichs from other movies so as not to unduly challenge the audience., The characters in Spare Parts all go through changes that are true to many immigrants\ decidedly mixed experiences in the American melting pot., If Stand and Deliver struck many as a hard-hitting look at life in the urban ghetto, Spare Parts seems like a Disney after-school special by comparison., Spare Parts is the kind of feel-good underdog movie that almost can\t help getting waylaid by cliches. Happily, the real story is strong enough - and unlikely enough - to overcome most of those kinds of problems."
The Loft ,0,"An exceptionally vivid picture of bohemian life during one of New York Citys most exciting eras., The bohemian paradise of this environment had a dark side, and the movie doesnt give it short shrift. Nevertheless, a genuine exhilaration holds throughout., Fishko is always on to the next striking image that will too quickly pass. Fortunately, that next thing is often a joyous surprise ..."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,0,"There is little in this film that is new, but that doesnt matter. The characters are still entertaining, the action scenes thrilling and near orgasmic, and the human relationships touching., Several thrilling action sequences, a great many good jokes, and an unshakable sense that everybody is just going through the paces., Joss Whedon set a higher bar with the first Avengers (2012) and tried, in many ways, to top it here. He got close..., Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches., Avengers: Age of Ultron is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe., More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh., The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World., At 141 minutes, its a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, its not fully human, either., For the most part, Avengers: Age of Ultron is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed., World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. Its work. Grunt work. For them. For us., If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered., It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?, The things a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, its also becoming more and more a bore., As much as you admire the polished, expertly choreographed entertainment...you feel as if theyre putting on a gymnastics display or an extremely high-tech tap-dance routine., Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward., The amazing thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron is that its reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties., Age of Ultron disappoints not because its irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet., Whedon & Co. provide more than enough glib jokes, FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make Age of Ultron a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now., Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon., The film is a work of craft, from the actors like Mr. Downey, who can deliver a comic line with the timing of a mouse trap, to the editors, Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, upon whom so much of the movies very elegant fluidity rests ..."
Kubo and the Two Strings,0,"Sweeping tableaux, a wonderful voice cast and adventure that feels genuinely folkloric make this a film that definitely deserves to be taken out of cellophane., A glorious flight of the imagination., It explores unexpectedly profound ideas of rebirth and destiny rewritten, like origami paper sheets refolded into another form., With utmost care applied to its every shot, the adults will be marvelling as much as the youngsters., The animation? Well, it robs you of breath, over and over again., Arrives as cherishable proof that it is still possible, amid heightened commercial imperatives, for digimators to push for reflective, affecting art., Bless Laika, really, for continuing to make films this singular, which reject any known formulae of childrens animation and dive creatively each time into an uncharted cosmos., Dazzling, complex, and unforgettable, Kubo and the Two Strings combines layered themes with a stop-motion visual style that is gorgeous and immersive., hile theres plenty of fun to be had from all this, theres not a hint of cuteness anywhere. The puppets have enormous vitality and theres a wonderful strangeness in the world they inhabit., Its triumphant as well as terribly sad., More often than not its a charming, Eastern-influenced myth thats beautiful to watch and enjoyable to follow., Kubo offers visceral thrills and visual splendor, but it also champions the importance of kindness, forgiveness, and embracing humanitys many imperfections., Kubo thrilled, dazzled and delighted me, brought tears to my eyes and broke my heart - in the end, not entirely in a good way., There are so many layers, Knight finding a way to navigate through them with dexterous ease, doing so without ever losing focus., The stellar achievement of Kubo is the animation itself., Stop-motion animation touches the next stage of excellence in Kubo. It all works: storytelling, direction, voice talent... the totality of artistry..., A gorgeous, memorable piece of work, taking risks and flights of fancy that most modern movies, family-targeted or otherwise, barely contemplate., Filmgoers whove suffered through a summer of superheroes, supervillains and sequels/snarky reboots, we now have something that genuinely casts a spell on viewers., The overall stunning nature of the work cannot be ignored., Kubo is bold and daring, telling a truly unique tale set in ancient Japan that is rich with the depth of a story passed down for generations."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ,0,"Fantastic Beasts is a charm, excelling when its allowed to be its own creature and falling short only when its forced to pay its franchise dues., Much of the films rapid-fire entertainment value and slick filmmaking style do a lot towards covering up the weak narrative excuses., Rowling imbues Fantastic Beasts from start to finish with a sense of discovery., It will make for a marvelous theme park attraction someday. But as a movie, as a vessel for narrative and ideas enacted by recognizably human characters, it fails to tap into the same simple potency that Harry and Co. wielded from book one., From the effects to the music to the performances to the battle scenes, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a worthy follow-up to the Harry Potter juggernaut., In all, the movie is a cunning and peppy surprise, dulled only by the news that no less than four sequels await., To its considerable credit, Fantastic Beasts is not the Potter retread it could easily-and very profitably-have been., This film has it all: a cracking story, a morality tale and moments of ripe comedy., This highly entertaining twist on jazz age America breathes fresh life into the Potter franchise - and, with its themes of society divided and the persecution of minorities, the film finds itself to be perfectly timed., Overall this is an enjoyable opening to what promises to be another popular film series about a world that, while not quite ours, seems close to it., The film strains considerably under the weight of all its plot lines-its never fun to be the movie with the origin story., Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them may not offer up the depth and the complexity of Rowlings other wizarding tales, but that doesnt make it any less of a good time., If nothing else, its fun to see that theres a Potterverse outside Harry Potter himself. His world has always been big enough to sustain other stories. Finally, it has a chance to., Whimsical but never wondrous, amusing but never affecting...The HP films showed us things we had never seen before. Fantastic Beasts just made me wish I were watching Doctor Strange again., Rowling has a voluminous imagination and Yates keeps things humming along, although, as was also true of many Potter movies, there is often too much of a good thing., Its spectacular and promising, though at first exposure its characters (human and otherwise) are often as grating as charming., The next Harry Potterfranchise kicks off with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which tries to combine a light-hearted heist with the rise of dark fascism. The combination doesnt quite work., At least the monsters, when compared with their co-stars, have some personality., A lavish visual feast that nonetheless fails to cast any new spells over its audience., The film exists resolutely outside of salience and doggedly within the comfort of escapism."
Eddie the Eagle ,0,"The overkill indicates an awareness that none of these would-be messages ring true., Watching this eagle take to the sky still manages to be a cheery delight., Eddie the Eagle is one of those underdog sports stories we all love so much, with an excellent performance from the likeable, empathetic Hugh Jackman., Peary is a completely fictitious character, but Jackman plays him like a younger Clint Eastwood, full of rugged charm and common sense, even though he stresses over his own past failures., It is both folk and fairy tale, but sort of irresistible. Everyone loves a rags-to-riches story, even if Eddie never quite won the riches., Its a recipe that worked for Rudy and Cool Runnings, and its effective here., Its not that making a period film in a throwback style is all that revolutionary. But it sticks out here because so many of these tropes are still in circulation., Worstward ho! Just leave your brains behind and its perfectly enjoyable., Not so much a movie, more a morale-boosting initiative, but briskly jolly, and given a dash of class by Jim Broadbent, Christopher Walken and a wonderfully unctuous Tim McInnerny., How to make a hero out of a loser? This is the question that drives, inspires, defines and ultimately bedevils the rousing new biopic Eddie the Eagle., The films heart is in the right place, but Jackman and Walken are all wrong., Dexter Fletchers unflinching determination to shamelessly hit every cheap chord cannot be faulted., An oddly conventional biopic that uses a strained father-son relationship to frame its rabble-rousing, crowd-pleasing reflection on futility., Fletcher has a brilliantly attuned sixth sense for what his audience wants to see at any given millisecond, and Eddies final flight, from the 90-foot ramp at Calgary, is a mini-masterpiece of intuitive cutting., Eddie the Eagle, despite its shortcomings, will soar into moviegoers hearts., Eddie the Eagle tries to have it both ways with its main subject, simultaneously ridiculing and ennobling him. And, amazingly, it mostly works., Taron Egerton reproduces Eddies offbeat charm, turning him into an Aspergers afflicted champion of the undertrodden., For every easy, eye-rolling bit, theres a moment of genuine emotion; the champion jumpers pre-climax speech on what matters in sport is downright joyful., Eddie the Eagle fits snugly into one of my favorite sports movie subgenres -- films about how sometimes losing is better, if it means that you stay true to your own moral code., While its often cookie-cutter sports movie conventional, youd have to be stone-hearted to remain un-charmed."
Hacksaw Ridge,0,"Gibsons robust directorial technique brings an undeniable punch to the combat scenes ... Elsewhere in the film, however, theres a sledgehammer lack of subtlety that is only partially mitigated by Andrew Garfields impressive performance., If they gave out awards for most movie in a movie, then no other movie need turn up., A rousing tale of Pacific War heroism that has more in common with jingoistic Wayne staples such as Sands of Iwo Jima or The Green Berets than anything in the 21st century, this is wearily formulaic film-making., Vintage Mel-odrama., Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned war film, melded with a kind of new-fashioned explicitly violent drama., Mel Gibsons Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best Second World War movies since Terrence Malicks The Thin Red Line. It is also a wildly contradictory affair, combining folksiness with a pathological quality., A sterling modern war picture with an intriguing moral twist., Occasionally soapy on the homefront but cataclysmic in combat, this is a worthy addition to the WWII canon., Hacksaw Ridge, the first movie Mel Gibson has directed in a decade, is about as Mel Gibson as you can get: grisly, devout, and patriotic, with a deeply complicated core., A fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd., Gibson has made a movie thats nearly pathological in its love of violence-but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks., Hacksaw Ridge is a fine motion picture, one whose themes and ideas obviously speak to the filmmaker, and if Doss story has helped change him as far as being a decent human being is concerned, that makes it all even better., As director, Gibsons approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera., For the sheer spectacle of the battle scenes, Hacksaw Ridge will go down as one of Gibsons finest contributions to cinema., By the time Hacksaw Ridge reaches its necessary messianic finish, its hard to not be moved by the boggling heroism of this dutiful man., War is hell, but Hacksaw Ridge sacrifices that truth in favour of something far more insincere., The battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge are among the most violent captured on film - and also the most urgent., The scenes in battle are as harrowing as any ever put on screen. We are in the midst of utter carnage and chaos., Hacksaw Ridge is being touted as Gibsons comeback. Is it also an atonement? Whats clear is that Gibson has made a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put to the test in an arena of violent conflict - a movie you dont want to miss., If the films director were anyone but Gibson, a fixture on or even atop Hollywoods enemies list, it would be expecting several Oscar nominations."
Kevin Hart: What Now?,0,"Youll be charmed and disarmed., Hart delivers a solid set despite the massive crowd, and appropriately, the funniest material deals with his newfound fame., Overall, its a package that will only be well-received by fans., But once he gets a rhythm going, and gets the audience tuned in to it, its hard not to get swept up., What now for Hollywood, which is bruising from the #OscarsSoWhite controversy while Kevin Hart shows up everywhere like hes the Orphan Black?, Are you a Kevin Hart fan? Then drop everything and rush to see this movie. Are you not a Kevin Hart fan? Then move along, theres nothing here to see..., Kevin Hart: What Now? is Kevin Hart at the top of his game. I just wish I had skipped the opening act the way I normally skip the previews., Theres a comfort to be found in Harts skyrocketing mobility that makes America clap and cheer and howl along. It hardly matters that his jokes arent that funny, or that he runs hack-y catchphrases into the ground for cheap laughs., What Now? is packed with laughs. What\s missing is a little bit of heart., Unless youre a loyal Hart fan, his latest concert film wont bowl you over., If you think Kevin Hart is funny -- as I do -- youll laugh frequently, as I did. If you dont, youre not going to this movie in the first place, are you?, The first half had me in stitches of helpless hilarity, but by the time comic Kevin Hart wrapped up his latest standup concert film with a series of tasteless sex jokes, I wanted out., I would strongly suggest that only those people who are already on-board with Harts profane, raucous, scatological and often rude family humour go to see this film. If you feel neutral or negative already,, Even if his jokes dont all land, his train of thought is all you need for an entertaining performance that is funny, angry and sometimes just weird., At times throughout this concert film, Kevin Harts brash honesty about himself can feel liberating., Sometimes raw but mostly just raucous, Hart generally pulls it off in his third concert film ..., This movie is not quite the comic event it relentlessly advertises in its opening and closing moments. But it is a reminder of the talent behind the hubris., Heres what matters most: You will laugh., Nobody works harder at getting a laugh than Kevin Hart. Its exhausting to watch., If you dig Harts stuff, youll probably love the movie."
The Light Between Oceans ,0,"With strong acting as its anchor, breathtaking cinematography accompanies this tale guaranteed to tug on those heartstrings., From lesser actors, the story would have definitely become the worst Nicholas Sparks film adaptation ever. But they make you feel for them, even when theyre making poor life decisions that you know will end miserably., Instead of tear-jerking, this approach eventually sees the audience dry-eyed with irritation., For those who have not read the book, there are some significant surprises in store -- while those who have will, I think, be satisfied with this handsome adaptation., By the end, you may be surprised at yourself shedding a tear or two but it wont inspire the kind of all-encompassing emotional heaving the best weepies induce., A grimly saccharine and interminably trite sea-sodden weepie., Cianfrance\s film is like a form pushed under our noses. On the dotted line at the bottom you can just make out the words: Cry here., Vikander and Fassbender are riveting in a handsome period drama that begins beautifully, but becomes increasingly contrived as it tries to wring as much drama as possible from its set-up., I suspect a doomed romance of another sort has unfurled: Acclaimed indie director falls for slush bucket best-seller and thinks he can redeem it with great cinematography and Oscar-winning actors., Stand back from this fable and examine it for logic, and you see how nonsensical it is., Contrivances and melodrama aside, it is emotionally true and thats often the most important thing for a film of this nature., The movie ends up seeming like an inchoate hybrid of melodrama and psychodrama-between the oceans, indeed., The movie errs most with its main plot, which requires the characters to behave with utmost stupidity, sacrificing its hard-earned storytelling for a frustrating payoff., Fassbender is glorious, while Vikander is his equal., The Light Between Oceans is stunning to see, and the performances are of the highest caliber, but its all packaged in a story that just doesnt earn its stay, or our tears., Fassbenderand Vikander, who fell in love during the making of the film, fully commit to their roles and hold us in their grip. The movie, sad to say, cant keep its head above water., Buried beneath this melodrama-but shining through nearly enough to justify a look-one can see the film that could have been., What the protagonists do is simply wrong, and their attempts to fix it are first tepid, then unpleasant., Theres real emotion and consequence in this three-hankie weepie. It earns its tears., Pretty sure I spotted a credit at the end of the movie for a tear-bucket grip."
The Infiltrator ,0,"The Infiltrator is what I like to call a decent Saturday laundry film, something that you can put on, walk away from it and let it run on its own for about 10 minutes, return to it and not be lost at all., Bryan Cranston is the most watchable, dangerous, frangible thing in The Infiltrator, a B-standard crime thriller based on the exploits of undercover narc Robert Mazur., Despite the viewer knowing (largely) where the film is headed, The Lincoln Lawyer director Brad Furman squeezes plenty of white-knuckle tension from the details., Holy Columbian marching powder, youll be hard-pressed to find a more adrenaline-soaked, palpitation-inducing, stress-ride at the cinema., Furman is obviously working in the long shadow of Martin Scorsese and the Breaking Bad team. Still, hes learned all the right lessons, especially when it comes to music., Cranston is excellent: we pick up on the barely perceptible flicker of fear in his eyes as he brazenly weaves his story. And Kruger impresses in a crucial supporting role., A shamelessly derivative but very energetic thriller that has Bryan Cranston in the kind of role that Al Pacino might have relished a generation ago., Cranstons talent - and Furmans - go a little to waste., Unlike its undercover hero, plays it very safe., Often gripping, and elevated by Cranstons superb central performance. But its hard not to feel like weve seen this before, often and done better., The best thing you can say about The Infiltrator is that Cranston and company are entirely persuasive in a film that doesnt make the best use of their stellar efforts., There arent enough adrenalin moments to supercharge a film that gets bogged down in exposition., It is a testament then to just how universally strong the acting is and how grand the set pieces Furman engineers that the film ends up mattering near as much as it does., This is a summer movie for grownups, the kind that reminds you how gratifying it can be to sit down uninterrupted and watch actors work on the big screen., It isnt even a particularly bad movie. Its just an uninspired one, a rummage sale of leftover parts from other, smarter films., By-the-numbers, but Cranston is always compelling., On its own limited terms, The Infiltrator, like its hero, delivers the goods., When director Brad Furman isnt focusing on huge closeups (which seems to be an awful lot of the time), hes focusing on all the wrong details., Its distinguished by its craft and verve., Composer Chris Hajian breaks out the percolating Jan Hammer synthesizers, and the 80s decadence wafts offscreen like a stink."
Ben-Hur ,0,"The movie isnt really saying anything, and is just cruising on the fumes left over from our associations with a classic., Ben-Hur isnt the worst film of the year, but from a technical standpoint it certainly looks it., Very rarely does it try to impress us, or overwhelm us, shock us, move us., Rankly incompetent., Somehow, Ben-Hur 2016 feels longer and duller than its predecessor., Whats wrong with the new Ben-Hur? How long have you got? This is a textbook case, step by agonising step, of how not to make a big-budget blockbuster., A thuddingly dull-witted remake of a biblical epic that wasnt exactly subtle to begin with., Fitfully entertaining but also curiously old fashioned, this is a film that only really sparks into life when the crowds are baying for blood and the chariots are in action. Apart from that, it seems like The Life Of Brian without the jokes., Epic fail., Call it wholemeal bread and circuses - an odd diet of sincerity and spectacle that nonetheless hits some kind of spot., Anyone wanting to experience the bigness of Ben-Hur would be advised to check out the 1959 or even the 1925 versions of the story -- both are vastly superior to this lamentable effort., Though it seems unlikely to dislodge William Wylers 1959 version, its story of a Judean prince (Jack Huston) who keeps running into Jesus of Nazareth (Rodrigo Santoro) offers plenty of action and spectacle., Like so many remakes, this one never answers the basic question of why this story was worth retelling in the first place., The result is a remake with no guiding principle beyond mere existence., An amateurish effort that boasts direct-to-video characteristics, the latest version disappoints in almost every production aspect., Something soulless and empty, with all the mystery and grandeur of the tale just gone., The last of the summers movie epics is a digitalized eyesore hobbled in every department by staggering incompetence., This new version of Ben-Hur is consistently at war with itself., Just because youre rolling in the chariot doesnt make you Charlton Heston. Thats a lesson this weightless, instantly disposable remake of the 1959 sword-and-sandal Oscar winner learns the hard way., Ben-Hur plays out, far from a modern day classic, but as spirited summer fare for an entertaining afternoon at the movies...."
Menashe ,0,"Joshua Z. Weinsteins film is very modest but never less than interesting in the insights it offers into this rarefied world on the edge of Manhattan., Its a film that just keeps getting stronger as it goes, unfolding almost imperceptibly and becoming deeper with each scene., It goes within one of the worlds most filmed cities to discover an environment rarely revealed to outsiders. But it also wins kudos for the emotional honesty of its uncomplicated narrative., This terrifically authentic look at life inside New Yorks Yiddish-speaking Hasidic community is a bittersweet treat - a vibrantly engaging portrait of down-to-earth lives that is affectionate, amusing and ultimately very moving., Whatever pickle he gets himself in, we cant help but root for Menashe., It is small and specific, admittedly, but it also tells a universal story about a fathers struggle to hold on to the son he loves, and it tells this story tenderly, thoughtfully, beautifully., Menashe is a deeply felt and absorbing Yiddish-language drama about New York Hasidic Jews., A brave step into uncharted territories. The superb leading performance from Menashe Lustig elevates this beautifully observed film. Well worth your time., Doubling as a fascinating look at a subculture that is normally sealed off from the rest of us and a gently amusing comedy of manners, this manages to say an awful lot by, paradoxically, saying it endearingly gently., Menashe the film is so intimate and so nuanced in its depiction of the woes of Menashe the character that theres really no need for anything else., Menashe is a little slice of life, delivered with a knowing sense of truth., The curious are welcome, but this one fits snugly in the category of You Don\t Have to Be Jewish, But..., Weinstein normally directs documentaries, and Menashe has a fly-on-the-wall feel at times, particularly in the warmly believable interplay between father and son. The movie was filmed in Borough Park, N.Y., which adds to the atmosphere., Weinstein brings a palpable authenticity (attributable in part to a cast made up of local non-actors) to this universally resonant story, rendering it unique and specific in a meticulously detailed setting., The subtle on-screen chemistry between father and son gives this sweet and poignant drama a solid emotional base., Delicately woven and sensitively told, director-writer Joshua Z Weinsteins ode to a shlemiel rings true., In scene after scene, Menashe strikes complex notes without telegraphing how the audience should feel., Some of the narrative developments and conversational tangents feel contrived, but Menashe has a rhythm (brisk but unforced) that speaks well of Weinstein\s future in narrative storytelling., This is Weinsteins first dramatic feature; hes been a documentarian, and that comes through in his ability to show Menashe in the context of his world., At times sweet, but never patronizing, Menashe examines a world that might seem foreign or oppressive without ever turning its inhabitants into caricatures or figures of fun."
Hostiles ,0,"The wants are grandiose, but the gains are minuscule., Christian Bale gives a typically half-measured, half-intense performance of a character who is mostly pretty awful but whom Hostiles wants to redeem for no clear reason whatsoever., The journey is beautifully shot by cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi, but Bales genius is wasted-hes often resigned to looking sullen and straining to recite the clunky dialogue., ... a strong, if overlong and over-obvious, western..., It offers shreds of hope, something we can cling to even now., By turns deliberative and chaotic, brutal and merciful, definitely bleak and just maybe hopeful, Hostiles could have ended with its penultimate scene, but it would have been a very different movie., Cooper is something of a master of macho poetry-he makes films about taciturn, often violent men who cant fully express the depths of their feelings., Hostiles is more in conversation with movies about the settlement of the West than it is about or in conversation with the brutal history of the West itself., Clearly influenced by classic Westerns, particularly the films of director John Ford, Hostiles is a worthy addition to the genre., As a handsome-looking western, Hostiles does the trick, but when it tries to probe deeper, it just comes up short., This harshly beautiful film is equally about his regeneration during the course of a journey that amounts to a parable of humanity trying to climb out of the pit of endless slaughter and retribution., Bale and Pike find a strange kind of peace within their characters, intuiting how tough it would be to live in a world where death is easier to contemplate than life., It ... engages the conventions of the genre - including ideas about male honor and egotistical frailty - in ways that feel alert and timely., Scott Coopers version feels timeless yet contemporary, diving headlong into the ongoing and often horrific impact of the United States policies and attitudes to indigenous culture., Theres a gritty integrity and plaintive poetry to this end-of-an-era western from Crazy Heart director Scott Cooper., Never noticeably bad, but never noticeably good either., The ultimate impression is of a rough society hacked from unwilling ground by violence in search of capital. Yet there is some hope in a lovely, extended final shot. A good way to finish off the cinematic year., Its myriad of layers and moral ambiguities arent sitting right there at the surface waiting to be explored., The true standout is the achingly riveting Rosamund Pike. As Rosalie Quaid, Pike becomes a force greater than the script at hand., Hostiles leaves a mark, and Bale gives the kind of smoldering performance that he\s used to delivering. In a heavy film, he brings the weight."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",0,"Perhaps it takes an outsider like McDonagh to get it right, but by pictures end, a few wrenches of plot unite the deplorable with Mildred and lend him a contrived sympathy., McDonagh takes the audiences loyalty and swings it around, taking you on an emotionally volatile, but fascinating, drive-by in rural America., ...tragic, comic, violent, tender and heartbreaking., Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri unfolds as a typical revenge vigilantly ploy, and could have stayed so under normal direction and screenwriting. Instead, it gets turned into one of the best pictures of the year., Sound too bleak? For some, perhaps. But in McDonaghs careful hands, its a Cirque du Soleil-like tightrope walk, gracefully balancing the harrowing with the humorous., The result suggests a greeting card spattered with gore. Beneath the little flecks of brain and bone, the Hallmark logo is unmistakable., While McDonaghs dialogue is ripe and chewy, McDormand has the power to speak volumes in silence., Martin McDonagh has crafted a magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns - its an experiential kaleidoscope., Three Billboards doesnt exactly fall apart, but too many implausible turns and uncomfortable gags impede the hitherto smooth machinery., Three Billboards is great., Watching it is like having your funny bone struck repeatedly, expertly and very much too hard by a karate super-black-belt capable of bringing a rhino to its knees with a single punch behind the ear., The narrative never goes where you think it will go. Instead, it takes your narrative expectations and shreds them before your eyes., As usual, McDonagh is alert to how conflicts are codified into games by opponents who share affinities., Strong, excitingly unpredictable stuff, this is a fabulously unforgettable genre cocktail from Martin (In Bruges) McDonagh., Funny, brutal and breathtakingly beautiful. Two exceptionally raw lead performances, supercharged by a bold script from Martin McDonagh, could make Three Billboards this years Awards-upsetter., Give all the awards to McDormand, and then invent a bunch of new ones for her too., There is, as you can see, a great deal going on in the film. At the start it feels like the basis for a straightforward thriller. But its much, much more than that., Cathartic or livable might as well be the Midwestern ethos; it\s the land of displacement, or being between two poles, and Three Billboards is a rare movie to so perfectly capture how there\s still beauty (and hope) in it., But while that is a rage that\s exhilarating to witness, it\s a rage that\s not available to everyone. Just as not everyone in Ebbing can claim the protection of being considering good, we still don\t live in a world where everyone gets to be angry., Despite my reservations, Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri is certainly memorably clever and boldly conceived. And any film that allows McDormand to strut her to stuff to this degree cant be all bad."
Okja,0,"Okja is a satire on corporate greed and how awful we are. I know people who stopped eating meat after they saw Okja., Essentially a pro-animal liberation movie, this becomes a pretty wild ride as the Korean child doggedly pursues the pignappers all the way to New York, Okja pushes Bong Joon Hos talent for spanning moods and genre conventions to its limit. The movie features his trademark sharp shifts in tone, but also melds Western imagery, music and cultural touchstones., Pitch-black satire, heartwarming devotion, over-the-top performance, and subtle drama are engineered into something decidedly (if improbably) delicious., The movie is enjoyable, but part of me wishes it had really gone there\u200a - I mean, why not?, It may not end up being my favorite film of the year, but I can easily see it being someones favorite-hell, I can see it being someones favorite film of all time. Its that special., What makes the jumble cohere, as usual with Bong, is his extraordinary grasp of space and speed, especially in the Korean half of the film., The best parts of the movie are also the least wacky., Its a sublime tale of the value of humanity, and the horrors we often have to suffer through to hold on to that., The fact that it exists at all, in what is so clearly a form unsullied by executive hands, is a victory. That its brilliant is a nice bonus., Its a testament to Bongs sprawling ambition that Okja manages to be so many things at once -- a caustic satire of corporate evil, an intercontinental action/adventure epic, a coming-of-age narrative for the girl., A strange, well-intentioned but heavy-handed girl-and-her-animal story that merely demonstrates Netflix still has a lot to learn about the movie business., The film shares Bongs casual ping-ponging of tones, his fascination with picking at societys many scabs, and the way his films frequently skid into violence and cruelty without warning., Okja moves seamlessly between fairy tale, action caper and crime drama., It will be a forgiving audience indeed that doesnt recoil from this approach, which is too much stick and not enough carrot., Chilling, subversive ..., Okja is an uneven but never complacent mix of fantastic fairy tale; social satire; heavy-handed commentary on corporate greed and our consumer-crazed culture, and bizarro action film., To me the idea that it will be largely confined to peoples living rooms seems absurd., One of Okjas great charms lies in its directors ability to vary tone, pacing, and style between scenes without losing the viewers patience and sympathy., Bong Joon-hos all-star eco-fable of a girl and her giant pig Is wacky, weird and wonderful. Its also part kiddie treat and part horrorshow, but hang on-its worth it."
Spark (2016 film),0,"Ultimately, Film Stars Dont Die in Liverpool is an extremely rewarding romantic drama and should appeal even to those unfamiliar with Gloria Grahame, McGuigans role is essentially to serve the script and the performers, and we can be grateful the project wasnt handed to a director more bent on imposing an authorial stamp., Bening finds the shattered beauty in Grahame, the tragedy of an ex-star hanging on for dear life to her waning looks and fame that has long since passed her by., Bening is outstanding as a woman who fears that her fame and beauty are slipping away, and Bell (Billy Elliot) brings to his character a heartbreaking vulnerability., Annette Bening is one of those rare actresses who makes a movie, however otherwise deficient, worth seeing., These are full-bodied performances, with Peters ardency and Glorias kittenishness signaled in a hungry look, a wag of the eyebrows. Fittingly, the films best scene needs no words, Worth seeing for Benings brave and touching performance as an actress past her prime., If the movie meanders, its refreshing to see a May-September romance in which May is played by the man for once and where the sex is happy, frank, and frequent., The screen romance of Film Stars Dont Die in Liverpool may seem as odd as the real-life pairing was, but its a credit to all concerned that the validity of it is never in doubt., The movie never delves that deeply into who Gloria Grahame was, aside from a femme fatale slinking across a black-and-white screen., Director McGuigan and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh paint Film Stars Dont Die ... in unapologetically sentimental tones., There is no escaping the essential flaccidity of the story., Annette Bening is so good in Film Stars Don\t Die in Liverpool that it makes up for a story that\s slighter than it should be., The central pairing lends it a touching intensity ..., What an astounding actress Annette Bening is. And shes at her very best playing Gloria Grahame, a screen siren of the 1940s and 1950s, who faced a health crisis in her final days with the help of a new love (a terrific Jamie Bell)., Provides scant evidence about why we should care about Grahame to begin with and how her fate was perhaps emblematic of movie sirens both past and present., Film Stars is no portrait of Grahame; its a pair of points that barely form a line. No shot in the film dares attempt to communicate more than one idea or emotion at a time., The fleshing out of the story feels thin, and sometimes nakedly contrived... Yet the film has moments of surprising grace and tenderness., Benings expert runs up and down the emotional register leave no room for doubt about Grahames charisma even when shes playing her own worst enemy., Film Stars is a basic biopic that, in spite of its fantastic leads, doesnt leave an impression."
Suburbicon,0,"You know what they say about the road to hell. Here the good intentions are so compromised they scarcely merit the description., A strong cast and talented director never make the whole add up., Clooney, what on earth were you thinking?, Feels like a bone-headed clone of Fargo., Watchable, lively, intricately designed, but with exotic plot contrivances and parallel storylines that dont fully gel., Clooney leaves his black characters short-changed (we barely get to know them) despite his heavy-handed highlighting of US racial injustice., In spite of a fantastic cast, Suburbicon never truly invites you in., Its white male mediocrity hard at work. It might have its moments, but mostly Suburbicon is an ill-advised, messy, and problematic film that flagrantly misses its own mark., The black characters are barely characters at all, and the murder mystery is a Hollywood hand-me-down., Suburbicon gives away the game on its mystery a bit too soon, but its still fun watching the various shoes drop., Suburbicons flaws are a result of its ambitions., Its a high-wire storytelling act thats difficult to imagine any director executing appropriately, and Clooney doesnt come remotely close to nailing it., Its A Raisin in the Sun Meets The Donna Reed Show., Only occasionally does an image strike a lyrical blow and yield the creepy effect that Clooney is aiming for ..., Its worth asking what kind of movie Clooney wanted to make-and what, exactly, he ended up with. A dark comedy? A tragedy? A thriller? A character study? Social commentary? All of the above? None?,  a jarring combination that goes together as well as peanut butter and poison., Clooney is too talented a filmmaker not to get in his licks. But this alternately comic and deadly earnest satire of the dark underbelly of 1950s suburbia -the Coen brothers had a hand in the script-is a movie that feels tonally at war with itself., Do we need to be told, yet again, that evil lurks beneath the picture-perfect surface of American suburbia?, Suburbicon goes immediately to the front of the line of contenders for the most disappointing film of 2017., Its a complex, conflicted movie that is as well intentioned as it is ultimately meaningless."
Rings ,0,"Overall, RINGS is sadly disappointing., The cursed video now looks like an experimental film made by somebody who has watched more Marilyn Manson videos than Stan Brackhage pieces. It does, however, provide clues to a mystery that really isnt worth solving., The characters are grossly incompetent, in addition to being vapid, and devoid of common sense. They each deserved what they get because each death meant the film was closer to ending., Rings proved to be nothing short of a complete waste of time, and if this video ended up on my laptop, tablet or any other digital device Id delete it off of the hard drive without a seconds hesitation., Pretty much everything about Rings is incoherent., Rings is an unfortunate and often incomprehensible mess that kicks off with a neat premise and then never fully explores it., In conceptualizing how it feels to be inescapably pursued by something thats embedded in your culture, 2015s It Follows is a much better sequel to The Ring., If crap movies carried penalties for inflicting torture on audiences, then Rings would merit a death sentence., Ring down the curtain, this franchise revival is not saved by the bell., It is cruel fate that planted Rings on a release date after weve learned that far scarier things can happen in seven days., Rings embodies a common problem of attempted franchise revivals: indecision about its intentions., In the end  Rings didnt make me want to drink Drano. It had enough distractions but thats a low bar for a horror movie that includes DOnofrio and Galecki, who could run rings around the rest of the cast given better material., Its not a terrible setup. But Rings doesnt end up doing much with its fresh ideas., The biggest problem with all of this is the overwhelming sense of apathy the film brings to almost everything., Fans of the franchise will probably be pleased ... Too many horror sequels are content merely to recycle what worked the first time., Its just another thoughtless cash-grab sequel in a horror-movie franchise better off dead., Rings cannot make sense of the hodgepodge of old and new mythology, which confuses a Samara origin story that had already been settled in the other entries., The story of Samara Morgan, once potent nightmare fuel, has become less scary with each new iteration, culminating in this new, ridiculous installment directed by F. Javier Gutiérrez., After 100 minutes, youre dead from boredom., Mostly Rings offers the warmed-up leftovers of a style that hasnt felt fresh since the first George W. Bush administration. Its an unkind rewind."
Brigsby Bear,0,"The rash of real-life cases in which women or children were kidnapped and held captive for years has played out on American movie screens as drama (Room), horror (10 Cloverfield Lane), and now cottage cheese., ... little of it makes tonal sense., Where the film best succeeds is in creating a credible character who has been insulated from the world he now finds himself flung into., Against the odds, Brigsby never descends into cynicism., For all the films celebration of imagination as a tool for escape, the trajectory it follows is too uninspired., A film about a cult that might well attract a cult following itself. But its only moderately successful, with the early scenes hinting at a bolder, more satisfying tale that could have been., As the film unwinds to a sentimental anticlimax, its potential is unfulfilled., Its often charming to watch James stumble through his new life with the glee of Jake Gyllenhaal as Jimmy Livingston in Bubble Boy., The film is in some ways an ode to the power of popular culture and the ways in which a very ordinary TV show (or pop song, or film) can worm its way into our subconsciousness., Dave McCary and his team have fun with the lo-fi aesthetics of the show within the film., Brigsby Bear is a funny, oddly touching look at the pros and cons of millennials\ tendency to obsess over pop culture., Brigsby Bear is the kind of movie Kyle Mooney would make fun of on Saturday Night Live., Those who like things sentimental and sweet - and theres nothing wrong with that - will find comfort in the notion of leaving the past behind to allow the future to go forward., A movie about storytelling that succeeds by keeping its focus on the storyteller., The approach can be a reach, but on the whole it works better than you might guess., Brigsby Bear is charming, sweet, creative, different and disturbing., Brigsby Bear can be accused of a lot of things, but lack of ambition isnt among them., What a strange and lovely road we travel with Brigsby Bear., An oddball charmer of a motion picture about nostalgia, the pursuit of artistic passion and a coming of age bizarrely delayed and uniquely fulfilled., An almost unbearably twee story about pursuing a dream."
The Snowman ,0,"There are many sequences that left me going, Wait, what?, This film may well be the last gasp of Scandi-noir for the international market...this phase of Nordic has gone from original to dutiful emulation to dreary self-parody., What to make of a film that introduces Chlo Sevigny happily beheading chickens with an axe, has her beheaded herself by the killer, then immediately produces a twin sister to deliver a single item of exposition before never being seen again?, The Snowman is two hours of uninterrupted, snow-caked boredom., ... the movie itself is an inept misfire - the kind of entrancing train wreck that makes you long for a behind-the-scene tell-all to explain what, exactly, went so wrong., How did a delicious Scandinavian noir novel go so spectacularly wrong on screen?, The Snowman is a slog., Not a single scene works as anything more than a total waste of good film., With a perplexing tale and some very odd creative choices, its so easy to laugh at The Snowman, but this kind of tale shouldnt inspire laughter., In this soul-deadening freeze, who wouldnt seek solace in a bottle? Or in the physical warmth of a lovers arms? Or in mass murder?, The storytelling in The Snowman is the cinematic equivalent of listening to somebody trying to remember the plot of a paperback they read in an airport 10 years ago., One of the most shockingly awful wastes of talent imaginable, this adaptation of Jo Nesbos thriller is mostly incoherent and, just when it starts to make sense, it is hijacked by a series of laughably bad clichs., Just know it is readily apparent who the killer is not fifteen minutes into the movie..., A twisty tale of inexplicable red herrings, baffling plot detours, and Chloe Sevigny as not one but two identical chicken farmers., The Snowman, despite the majestic location cinematography, falls rather flat., The movie plays as if he threw in the towel in the editing room. Its a stiff., Its bad. A bit of a full-on Nesbner, in fact., Its a pity, because theres some squirmy vitality in the hothouse premise., That look isnt enough to overcome a sluggish pace and increasingly implausible plot. Frozen red herrings are still red herrings., Completely, atrociously, perhaps even impressively, stupid."
The Happy Prince ,0,"By turns melancholy, witty, brutal, and sensual, the film is distinguished by its artful weave of time and memory, and by Everetts uncompromising performance as Wilde during his final years., Everetts direction is full of beautiful surfaces and witty lines, but theres not much beneath them., Actor Rupert Everetts mistitled The Happy Prince marks his debut as a film director, and the subject matter is clearly close to his heart., An honest-but-shapeless portrait that is more than warts-and-all. Its all warts., Im a little frustrated that I didnt enjoy the movie more than I ultimately did., There are scenes during which Everetts Wilde commands our wide-eyed attention, still mesmerizing despite his physical and psychological decline. Yet in between those quickened moments, The Happy Prince trudges forward with monotonous uniformity., Given a role built exactly to his strengths, Butler also gives maybe his finest performance as Hunter Killers first-time commander., The title of Oscar Wilde\s fairy tale The Happy Prince was not his subtlest use of irony, but as seen in Rupert Everett\s film that bears the same name, it was tragically apt., Florid but warmhearted - much like the man at its center - The Happy Prince is a haunting portrait of the aftermath of betrayal; of how the master of comedy became a tragedy., Its a passion project that never devolves into mere passion; a sober (if loving) look at an inebriated soul., Everett delivers a towering and persuasive performance in a mostly sombre and sorrowful film and, as director, does a fine job of capturing the period detail., The Happy Prince conveys the declining Wilde\s pain, despair and self-pity, but also the writer\s defiant banter., Director-actor Rupert Everett tackles Oscar Wilde in his later years, and proves this was the role he was born to play. Get ready to marvel at an award-caliber performance., What Everett brings to the table--as a director, writer, and actor --is his intuitive take on Oscar Wilde and the performance alone makes this riveting and revelatory viewing., Despite its undercurrent of anger at Wildes mistreatment by fashionable English society, the film feels like a vanity production..., Everett is a massive Wilde fan, and knowing his appreciation for the material makes up for its deficiencies in style., Tells the gay scribes tragic, slyly poetic story in a dreamy, inventive and beautifully crafted way that decidedly sets it apart., Its possible to see the flaws in The Happy Prince and still be deeply moved by Everetts immersive, full-bodied portrayal of the writer., Beneath the prosthetics, theres genuine pathos in Mr. Everetts portrayal of a man bitterly aware that his talents are unreliable armor against the perceived sin of his homosexuality., Because of the lack of depth in supporting characters and half-baked writing, this movie couldnt have ended fast enough."
Deadpool 2,0,"Everything that you got in the first film, you get times three., If you like your cinema understated and refined, then this is not for you. But for the rest of us, theres enough to enjoy here., I dont think the second film is terrible, I did find it quite dull., You know when you first see a meme thats fresh, still funny? Now, think about when you see that same meme after 4 months worth of riffing....thats Deadpool 2., ...no grand satire here, just self-awareness - and enough surprises, solid jokes and well-crafted action sequences to be entertaining., I enjoyed Deadpool 2. For its humor, for its action sequences, for its relentless breaking of the fourth wall, and for giving us real, undeniable queer ladies., I loved this movie, I think its funnier and more intelligent than its predecessor, but I know its not for everyone., Reynoldss underlying sweetness takes the edge off the comics homicidal self-pity, though the endless shtick has a miss-to-hit ratio of about three to one., Deadpool 2 is an R-rated, potty-mouthed splatterfest and a funny one., Deadpool 2 goes bigger than the first, but the shockingly touching family theme pulls all of the new characters and big set pieces together well. Another wild, hilarious ride for the character with just enough honesty and heart., Theres very little to enjoy here., Nearly everything about the original Deadpool was fresh and funny, from the opening credits to the parody of Marvel movie finales. Deadpool 2 suffers the fate of so many sequels: weve seen its best ideas before., Depending on your appetite for this stuff, the constant self-reference and breaking of the fourth wall is either a shameful cheat or a release from the sameness of the superhero template., His jibber-jabber gets tiresome after a while, however, and irreverent, subversive and shocking humour is funny only upto a point. After which, the grand action scenes aside, it feels like a pattern: Offend. Kill. Make an inside Marvel joke. Repeat., For all the impulsive flamboyance of Deadpool\s patter, the liberating power of personal virtue, and the disinhibiting promise of second chances, Deadpool 2 feels narrowly impersonal and oppressively unfree., Just as Robert Downey, Jr. has become the definitive Iron Man, Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. Its the role he was born to play and whenever hes on screen, the movies inner classic shines forth., All in all, I prefer a Marvel movie that doesnt take itself seriously, but the nonstop unseriousness of Deadpool 2 can wear you down, too., Instead of seeking to top the over-the-top antics of the first film, both director and star are content to simply groove with what theyve already established and just have fun. The result is less exhausting and more entertaining., Deadpool 2 embraces its enhanced output of blood, guns, and violence with open arms...before theyre blown off., A little of Deadpools incessant winkiness goes a long way, and by the time the movie was over, all I felt was sore."
American Animals,0,"American Animals is a different kind of movie, a truly electrifying story with purpose and meaning but one that has also given us a new form of storytelling., Its a clever movie, but not too clever. Its also thoughtful and engrossing, weird as hell. And its true - or truer than most films that claim that label., American Animals, like the young thieves whose story it tells, seeks inspiration from classic movies, but it transcends this foundation in a probing look at the arrogance and inexperience of its protagonists..., Its a clever film even when its characters are the opposite., Supremely watchable and surprisingly poignant..., A very haunting film., At times, the film seems as hardboiled as the heist thrillers that Warren and Spencer study on DVD but the director never loses sight of the absurdity of the plan or of the bungling amateurism of the perpetrators., Other directors have folded real-world figures into fictional narratives. Its the scale of the invasion that sets Laytons project apart., The movie reaches strange and savage heights...not just because it seems to be engaging with huge philosophical questions about the nature of identity in the modern world. Its more focused than that, because the context is specifically American., Its really the style and performances, more than the pseudo-experimental structure Layton has chosen, that keep the film grabby., This is a film that takes deep pleasure in itself. Much of the time, you will be pleased with it too., American Animals manages to be simultaneously fast-paced and contemplative., I was on the edge of my seat., A documentary about the fictions we tell ourselves, a fiction about the reality we can never escape., American Animals is sharp, smart, often bravura filmmaking, a terrifically entertaining mix of fast facts and pulp fiction. But beneath the flash is a sad story of teens who feel their lives simply arent good enough., Every actor turns in a enthralling performance and the four subjects have sincere, intelligent, and charismatic personalities. But it doesnt change the fact that making a film about them is an advertisement for while-male privilege in America., American Animals is one of the year\s smartest, most captivating films, and Layton stages it with the precision of a perfect crime., The kids\ meticulous preparations begin with typing how to plan a heist into Google and continue with watching every heist film ever made, though they manage to overlook the primary lesson of all such films-that something always goes wrong., It hits the usual genre beats, and plays a predictable rock soundtrack as it lurches between comedy and drama, but neither the story nor the characters really mesh., American Animals offers a truly poignant look at what it costs us to cross an invisible line between right and wrong."
Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,0,"Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again blends kitsch and nostalgia delightfully, dressing it up in Greek shades of white and blue and vivid 70s style., Ol Parker has managed the impossible by offering a sequel which is as impressive, if not better than the original., Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again never pretends to be anything but what it is, which is goofy, campy, and irresistible., Cast aside any fears that the primary goal is to sell package holidays and compilation albums, because this time at least they have put on a diverting show., I suppose one of its themes is that we all get older. Thats true enough, but I dont need to be alerted to it by the SOS of Brosnan speaking through a song and walking through a dance., I cant wait for the next chapter of the Mamma Mia! Cinematic Universe., It cant rival the relentless ecstasy of the original, but at its best moments, it comes close., The thing about Mamma Mia 2 is that it feels less like a movie, and more like a live musical at which you are an active participant., Euphoria! Tears! Fernando! Dagnabit. This film will leave you high and wet. And willing (almost) to contemplate the prospect of Mamma Mia 3., I simply cant imagine how Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again could be any better than it is. I loved it to pieces and I cant wait to go again!, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, for all its faults, has a musty charm and even, for reasons that involve Meryl Streep, a hint of heartbreak., This exuberant sequel easily tops the 2008 musical hit., Whats notable about the broadness, though, is that it stays clear of grandiosity., Breathe a sigh of relief; this even-more bizarre sequel to an already bizarre original (based on the 1999 jukebox musical) is going to be ridiculous, of course. But fun, too., This sequel plays like a familiar song covered by a lesser artist, but the good parts are still intact. If youre in the mood for a dance, take the chance., When all is said and done, this sequel is brighter, funnier and more touching than anyone could have hoped., This is a visually appealing, thoroughly innocuous movie that you could safely take your grandmother to see. But I predict that it will have the staying power of Grease 2., Comes across as an all-too-strenuous cash grab for the earlier films mega-success., Thanks heaven for Cher since Streep is barely in it and the Abba songs are from their B-side, leftovers collection. Like Trump voters, fans of this jukebox-musical franchise see only the good in it, despite irrefutable evidence to the contrary., Whats not to like? To some people, a summer film means car chases and super heroes. To me, its a film like this: the cinematic equivalent of a juicy beach read."
Red Sparrow,0,"Director Francis Lawrence... seems to have reasoned that, because Russian literature is so long and slow, making his movie long and slow would be the path to authenticity., There is only so much Jennifer Lawrence can do in this set up., Needlessly sadistic and often troubling in tone, some keen supporting performances cant save this uneven and forgetful film., There isnt much chemistry between the leads, and their sex scenes dont sizzle, but the fault lies with the dopey, confusing script by Justin Haythe that fails to develop their characters with any depth or purpose., Red Sparrow sounds as if it has a foolproof recipe: sex, spies and Russia. But the only way to make sense of this thudding, clichéd would-be thriller is to think of it as an unintentional comedy., Jennifer Lawrence throws herself into her role with abandon (cf. mother!), suggesting, pace how some directors cast her, that her bravura dramatic energy flourishes best in worlds of genre extremes., A ponderous and abstract yet fascinating spy thriller., We remain in suspense. We dont know who is hiding what from whom. The emphasis on styling reinforces this dynamic, but it also inevitably takes away from the kind of characterization that marks an actually good spy movie., Red Sparrow is intended to be a sexy thriller, but its little more than a canvas for one directors limited vision of women, of which there are only two stereotypes., Lawrence spends much of the new film looking blank and sculpted, and all the double-dealings lend her not a tincture of mystery., The film is too anchored by silliness to take off., Red Sparrow is a promising beginning to a potential new spy franchise. Just be aware of its unexpectedly barbed edges., The tone is relentlessly bleak, and for all its depraved sexuality the films gaze is more drooling teenage boy than genuinely adult or erotic., Its the centerpiece of high-gloss, highly sexualized espionage claptrap with an overlay of faux female empowerment: Dominika is pretty much an equal-opportunity scourge., Red Sparrow is like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, but only if it were directed by Showgirls-era Paul Verhoeven. Thats something of a compliment, but its also a warning., Lurid but not quite trashy thriller from director Francis Lawrence, who puts his Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence through trials that never made it into their previous, PG-13 collaboration., By homing in on her character, the filmmakers stay true to her part of the book, but they cut away too much of what gives this kind of entertainment its charm and variety., This is a cleverly scripted, well-acted and in its way timely movie, but not one for the squeamish., Jennifer Lawrences focused, nakedly raw performance is sensational., There is, one suspects, a post-Cold War caper buried deep in this muddled, insanely boring film. But apparently it has no intention of surfacing or blowing its cover."
Kin ,0,"Mostly works, despite some occasionally thudding B-movie dialogue., The sci-fi film Kin has a potentially interesting central relationship between two brothers, but how it positions a gun as something that gives a boy confidence is less than ideal., If the Baker boys truly were fabulous, theyd have had the guts to go all the way and earn an R rating., Even for the realm of YA sci-fi, the boy-befriends-a-gun storyline of Kin is pretty messed up., Kin proves to not be one thing or the other, defying any clear genre or demographic boundaries. Its not a blockbuster or a heroic young adult tale, just a devastatingly sad and terrible story..., The movie is a mess, a tonal nightmare that never manages to create an authentic time or place thats even moderately believable., Given the films title, and that the filmmakers are themselves twins, you would expect the brother relationship at the heart of the movie to be something more than it is., At times dull and plodding and at other times cartoonishly silly, Kin rarely works and, when it does, its often for the wrong reasons., Although Kin doesn\t cut it, some of its ideas are worthy of further development., A disjointed and at times off-putting mess that veers wildly and unconvincingly between a road movie, a family drama, a violent crime film and an offbeat sci-fi thriller., In the hands of more playful creators, this adolescent fantasy could have been fun., The performances are solid, and Quaids presence lends an extra solemnity to the family-drama aspect of the film. Francos performance, however, may prove distracting to those familiar with his turn in Spring Breakers., Random ideas, vague characters, stolen plot-points -- this thing barely qualifies as a movie., Truitts quiet wariness is the finest thing in a movie full of good acting., Its to the credit of the Bakers, screenwriter Daniel Casey, and the solid cast that this character-based core does hold the movie together, mostly sidestepping pat sentimentality and too-easy narrative solutions., Kin is not a snoozer, at least, and the Baker brothers are certainly not untalented, but their genre-mashing experiment doesn\t work on any emotional level., Jonathan and Josh Bakers Kin, a feature that comprises little more than an extended introduction to its characters, resembles a TV pilot thats been released into theaters as a standalone property., Probably could have worked as a straightforward drama about two troubled brothers, or as a road trip that slowly takes on mythic sci-fi proportions, but its chocolate-and-peanut-butter combination of the two feels disjointed and unsatisfying., Having lit the narrative fuse, the helmers dont always manage to keep it burning, and the intended emotional payoff arrives more as tacked-on explanation than revelatory sock to the solar plexus., Kin poses more questions than it answers, and theyre not the cool, speculative kind."
The Lion King ,0,"Watch this Lion King for the technical achievement and musical numbers, and then watch the original to feel satisfied., Overseeing such a massive technical production as this one requires a filmmaker to be on top of every nuance and detail in play. Actor/director Favreau is the right person for the job., The Lion King captures just enough of the originals warmhearted excitement -- and introduces enough new delights -- to feel like more than a cynical Disney money grab., Though by no means a bad movie, The Lion King wouldve been better off trying to be more of its own movie, do something different in terms of story and character, and aim as high narratively as it achieved with its extraordinary visuals., Even if you somehow made it into the new Lion King without knowing its origins, you might start to wonder if there was another version of it that made more sense..., The Lion King feels less like watching a cohesive film and more like listening to a separate audio track narrating what is happening onscreen. The two halves dont mesh., Despite the superstar talent of the cast and the stunning presentation, it misses some of the heart that placed the original securely in the pop culture canon., The original The Lion King had gorgeous hand-drawn animation, oodles of charm and a great, beating heart. This one is almost a frame-to-frame remake., The weight of the production and the hubris of its technological aspirations accent the story flaws that were always part of The Lion King. This is one Disney fable that should have stayed a handmade tale., As directed by Jon Favreau, its an achievement of technology not artistry., Rarely has brand recognition soared to such fetishistic heights, and I regret to inform you that, aside from the updating of the vocal cast, the most blatant discrepancy between the old and the new is a very slight increase in the comedy of flatulence., Im very impressed with how they did...I just love cartoons. This is a movie that said sit there, weve done all the work., While there are dashes of cute and colourful revelry, the question remains: did we really need a near-faithful remake with added flab?, Its the soundtrack and the star voices - both in the English and the Hindi versions - that bring things alive, specially in some throwaway light moments, like a affianced-betrothed wordplay or a hornbill vs woodpecker debate., By this point, Disneys do-overs feel a lot like their cash-grabby, inspiration-free 90s direct-to-video sequels, only with vastly better production values., No matter when you first discovered Simbas story, the live-action Lion King will leave you speechless., For grownups - as opposed to the happy cubs who will adore them for taking them to The Lion King - this remake doesnt feel like visionary storytelling so much as a proving ground for newer technologies: virtual reality and other immersive techniques., Where the animated original had an endearingly cheery anthropomorphism, with wide eyes and cute expressions, this lacks that. Youre marveling at the beauty of the animals, but it just doesnt work with the material., In the end The Lion King left me longing for the emotional moments of the first film., Youll want to pluck Simba from the screen and give him a cuddle."
Changeland,0,"Not everything in the script shows that same care, but this is still an interesting, if not wholly successful first feature from the star., Everyone from boat-tour guides to shot-bar patrons find time to ask our hero solicitous personal questions. If only he, or the film, had more interesting answers."
Isn't It Romantic ,0,"As funny as it is about sending up romantic comedy conventions, Isnt It Romantic also embraces what makes them so compelling., The big studio rom-com is back!, We now have an official subgenre in which a woman is initially presented as unattractive; is concussed into a fantasy in which she becomes impossibly desirable; and from the experience gleans important, affirmative lessons about believing in herself., It\s way better than you would expect for a movie with the description Rebel Wilson and Liam Hemsworth rom-com., A weird meta take on romantic comedy., Isnt It Romantic had us at hello but loses its spell when it has to develop its plot. Not as smart or sharp as youd hope, it still delivers a lot of fun for those who cant resist a bad Katherine Heigl flick., Rebel Wilson is consistently funny and earnest in Isnt It Romantic, leaning into doubtfulness without being hurtful to her friends who do appreciate the romantic comedies she hates., Isnt It Romantic is unnecessary but it is diverting all the same and even has some wise things to say about regressive rom-com tropes., It will leave you smiling, and maybe a little bit hopeful about romance., Wilson may not be a radical reimagining of the rom-com protagonist, but she does represent an expansion of its previously narrow parameters. It cant and wont upend a template it holds so much obvious affection for. But it does model a path forward., Unlike other movies where women bang their heads, this ones got a brain., While Wilson has a delightful mix of spirit and cynicism that makes her an ideal comic presence for the Internet age, I found myself wishing the film took better advantage of her gifts., Isn\t It Romantic, the film, is a dream that can be heard, but only as a counter melody to the main theme., Its hard to get too mad at what amounts to a sweet, funny throwback that revels in being cute., Rebel Wilson kills it, even if the satire needs more bite., Its the Inception of rom-coms. Sort of., Though the movies tropes have been written about or spoofed before in funnier films like They Came Together, this breezy take has heart and a clever resolution., Comic tornado Rebel Wilson lifts up this meta-take on romantic comedies and makes it your best bet for a Valentines date at the movies. Too bad about the sucker punch of a happy ending., As the film becomes increasingly reliant on predictable narrative tropes, it evolves into the very thing it set out to parody., Isnt It Romantic just thumbs its nose at the genre before relenting to it, like a self-inflicted defeat."
Triple Threat ,0,"Your scorecard will be full, which is the point., Triple Threat does not deliver on its kinetic casting promise., Even if it all is ridiculous I kind of loved this brutally visceral action extravaganza anyhow."
The Good Liar,0,"With actors like these in top form theres never a dull moment, even when the film delves into flashbacks set in the distant past., Its an enthralling exercise but a peculiarly cerebral one -- a psychological thriller without the thrills., The Good Liar shifts our character sympathies so fully that youll relish the comeuppance on display, but the script telegraphs the emotional impact of this twist., Wait for Britbox., The Good Liar is a pleasantly playful thriller hiding a seriously shady history close to its benighted heart., It begins like a good David Mamet play woven into a good Agatha Christie mystery... They undermine it all at the end of the movie... Nevertheless, wonderful performances by Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen., McKellen and Mirren are game, but The Good Liar is running a clunky con., For their first appearance together onscreen, Condon distills from the McKellen-Mirren team an energy that is devastating., The Good Liar is a soggy thriller that I never felt an emotional connection to., The more we learn about the main characters, the less we believe theyd do the things they do., Through it all, however, Mirren and McKellen never waver. Smooth at being smooth, their conviction always convinces us, and their ability to register multiple subtle changes of emotion is consistently impressive., The Good Liar is ultimately a near-miss that offers up a few reasonable diversions along the way, the main one being the inspired pairing of the two leads., The calculation couldnt be clearer. Put two superb performers together and youre on your way to making an exceptional movie. Not so fast, though. The Good Liar is calculation from arch start to hollow finish., Preposterous tosh., It\s mostly good fun, though the final plot contrivance feels like a letdown. Still, with McKellen and Mirren for company, you could do a lot worse than The Good Liar., The fun of The Good Liar is that, just when you think you\ve got a proper handle on what\s going on, your reality is completely shattered., Yes, you would watch Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren in virtually anything. You just wish it wasnt this., To avoid ruining the film, you should not only stop reading this review, but also pass on seeing the movie, which tips its hand practically from the moment the main characters meet., But in trying to take a simple crime set-up and stretch it into a more sweeping tale of vengeance and victimhood, The Good Liar has to make some fairly preposterous moves to get there, and it doesn\t do a very good job of cloaking them., Instead of deepening his material, Condon has made an unsuccessful fling of a movie: fun for a while, but trying to get as far as it can by leaving crucial material off of its profile."
The Obituary of Tunde Johnson,0,"I was so impressed by the way it found a totally inspired avenue into the familiar Groundhog Day structure., The Obituary of Tunde Johnson takes an eerily unique and effective aim at the ongoing slaughter of young black men by white police officers. Tunde stands in for those whose keening obituaries weve already read., An agonizing tale about the weight society hoists upon too many black gay mens weary shoulders, its the kind of film that lingers in your mind days after youve seen it, as much due to the relevant subject matter as to Tundes penetrating gaze., The cumulative assassinations begin to ache like a mysterious bruise, making the audience feel the psychic weight of living in fear. Yet, the style of the film is more teen soap opera than vérité miserablism."
Seberg,0,"Kristen Stewart does fierce work as the radicalized 60s actress, but the biopic too often wanders elsewhere., Sebergs life was quite interesting, but alas, this film is not, and thats a shame, because she was so much more than the girl in that iconic shirt wandering Paris with Jean-Paul Belmondo., Seberg provides a chance from Stewart to move from hubris and naïvete, to fear and paranoia, and finally to a kind of fragmentation., Everything about this is so superficial and the dialogue spells out absolutely everything., The chief problem with Seberg, as is often the case with biopics, is that the filmmakers never really find the character underlying the historical figure., Seberg is played by Kristen Stewart, and thanks to sterling work by the costume and make-up department she looks more like Seberg than you might have imagined..., Its an indulgent picture, a performance in search of a vehicle, a feat of set-dressing rather than the engrossing drama Jean Seberg deserved., Alas, Australian director Benedict Andrews has no insight into this tragic story. Hes more interested in making Seberg palatable to viewers who might see her as a Left-wing extremist or, indeed, a liberal phoney., Kristen Stewarts performance burns with far greater intensity than the middling material that surrounds it., An interesting film...the performances are very good, and Kristen Stewart is always interesting to watch because she completely commits to performances..., This portrait of a woman pushed to breaking point coheres around a fine, friable performance from Kristen Stewart., The film... is fantastically flat., By the end, it feels as if the real Jean Seberg has been edged out of her own biopic., The film never quite rings true., For all her charisma, the miscasting of Stewart isnt helped by a berserker wardrobe department. The costumes wear the movie - the story is half-buried under a pile of sherbet lemon negligees., Stewarts magnetism cant compensate for the scripts sketchiness. Sebergs story deserves to be told - what a tragedy that this biopics finest feature is its frocks., Considering the horrors that constitute the current volatile political situation in America, Seberg is more relevant than ever., Miss Stewart is just extraordinary... She inhabits this performance., Whatever the flaws in this wobbly tale of the FBIs persecution of actress Jean Seberg, the body-and-soul performance of Kristen Stewart is not one of them. Stewart reminds us of Sebergs once vibrant strength and defiance and stands up for her truth., However well-intentioned the effort to unearth Sebergs legacy and open this shameful chapter in American History, the movies simplistic approach doesnt quite do her memory justice."
The Gallows Act II,0,"Im not convinced anyone involved with this film really wanted to make it., This is an unappetizing hash of It Follows and A Nightmare on Elm Street, as well as countless post-Candyman fright flicks about curious kids conjuring bad mojo., Emphatically unimaginative., The movies finale offers a twist that ostensibly ameliorates the internal-logic complaints. But it most vividly registers as a rancid misogynist cherry atop a sloppy concoction of tired jump scares."
Hustlers ,0,"Hustlers is a triumph., Its easy to get lost in the visceral joy that comes with watching women move this way., A heist thriller-cross-social drama, Hustlers weight is wrapped in the veneer of diamantés and stilettos, but there is real substance here., ...the script and plot are dull and obvious. The attempted humour is anything but funny., The hard-boiled exchanges between the women have a genuine exuberance, recalling Hollywood movies of the 1930s where showgirls trade wisecracks backstage., As good as Lopez and her onscreen accomplice Constance Wu are, they cant act what isnt in the script; other than a dedicated work ethic, were never given access to their thoughts., Through the peephole of Lorene Scafarias camera, a world pirouetting on and catering to the male gratification becomes a joyous playground for womens empowerment., So here come words we werent necessarily expecting to write : give Jennifer Lopez the freaking Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress right now., With a refreshingly dynamic soundtrack and impressive costume design, its fair to say that almost everything about the film works as intended, It understands its characters, understands its world...its fun, and I thought Jennifer Lopez was very, very good., Hustlers recreates the riveting crime story for a semisweet feel-good movie thats entertaining from start to finish., Hustlers is arguably the finest performance Jennifer Lopez has ever given, and there is no way for me to be unbiased about that fact. Her performance is as magnetic as it is layered, loving and warm as it is fearsome and dangerous., Constance Wu, Mette Towley, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart and a cameo by ex-stripper Cardi B add magic as the women go from self-help, to self-employment, to self-infliction., Jennifer Lopez is just absolutely astounding in every single way., Lopez is captivating with all the right moves, and theres not a bad performance in the house, albeit most feel smaller., J-Lo is the only reason to see it., Its meant as a compliment when strong females are called ballsy, but it would be truer to say that J-Los extraordinary creation is vagina-y., Hustlers is a classically made film about capital - sexual, social and financial., A lean, fierce take on the nature of female empowerment in an inherently corrupted world., This is a deeply feminist film, one where men are given less screen time than the cameoing Cardi B and Lizzo."
Antebellum ,0,"It proves how hard it is to make a remarkable film like Get Out or Us...this works on paper but doesnt earn its keep on screen., The visual style (lots of slow-mo) is sometimes overdone. But the ideas are alive, Monáe is a star and the drama is quietly unsettling., Its an audacious swing - but ultimately a miss from a pair of filmmakers who know exactly what they want to say, and havent yet mastered how best to say it., Antebellum doesnt so much concertina the past and the present as do a leering jig back and forth, then blow you a callous raspberry instead., Antebellum offers neither a coherent social commentary nor - thanks to its pat, ahistorical ending - a revenge thrillers catharsis., Monáe aside, the cast should perhaps have been reminded that their performances were actually being filmed., Who is this movie for? Antebellums portrayal of slavery is neither revolutionary nor unique., Antebellum sprinkles its under-considered plot with elements that recur but are never explained... Meanwhile, the more difficult questions behind Antebellums world-building choices go unaddressed., In the end, Antebellum will inspire conversation, just probably not the one the filmmakers anticipated., At its heart, and at its best, Antebellum is a grand play on what we know people really mean when they shout to Make America Great Again., The style of the direction is so lurid and the performances are so florid that they become ends in themselves and never mind the message no matter how timely it is in the current climate., Worst of all, that final reveal simply doesn\t work. It\s a grand, if blindingly obvious, political statement that screams, We care! without any weight., With luck, Monáe will be cast in more roles as smart as she is. This one is merely clever - a grimly provocative entertainment whose greater meanings are gone with the wind., Not every horror film with a social message can be Get Out, and they shouldnt be striving to imitate that., It loads up on visceral scares and disturbing imagery in service of a shallow film that feels like a gory theme-park ride showcasing the horrors of slavery., Even if we didnt live in a country where a shockingly large fraction of people think Confederate monuments are A-O.K., Gerard Bush and Christopher Renzs Antebellum would resonate like the boom of a Union Army cannon., Antebellum presents a powerful idea, but then just hands you a surface level presentation of it. While Im very eager to see what Bush and Renz do next, its unfortunate that Antebellum had so much potential but failed to add to the conversation., A well-made drama on slaverys horrors builds to an exasperating ending...After all the sadistic violence, the big twist is a big bust., This socially-conscious horror film with systemic racism as the monster trips over its ambitions, but Janelle Monae in her first starring role burns with ferocity and feeling., If youre paying attention, you can figure out the mystery at Antebellums center within its first 10 minutes."
The Secrets We Keep,0,"The central dilemma, nonetheless, is so compelling that it smooths over the imperfections. And the final shots are satisfying and chilling., Rapace... lifts the picture above its more formulaic instincts., All in all, its an engaging if pulpy drama., The Secrets We Keep is a solid, well-acted, and slightly predictable drama of morals whose novelty evaporates once you realize that the general beats of the story itself have been presented before, to far more haunting effect., A listless, half-baked, vaguely Hitchcockian thriller., The Secrets We Keep blends the best of B-movie thrillers and black box theatre., In its modest package, it asks some interesting questions., What grates about director Yuval Adler and his co-writer Ryan Covington pilfering so obviously from Ariel Dorfmans work is that they havent done anything particularly interesting with it., This movie examines disturbing issues in the most unhelpful way possible., Neither fully convincing nor particularly original, its narrative running a course that feels somewhat predictable from the outset. But its still strong enough to be effective..., An exploitation film that proceeds as if it were a solemn memorial, The Secrets We Keep doesn\t do right by the Holocaust history it invokes - or much else., At its weakest its distractingly off-key; at its strongest its steeped in an almost ghostly atmosphere of trauma, peering into what we what we choose to look away from or bury in silence - and how long that can endure., The film is ultimately too tidy to embrace anything truly startling or unexpected, either stylistically or narratively."
Arkansas ,0,"The dialogue is hard-boiled and the cast includes reliable tough talkers: John Malkovich, Vince Vaughn and Michael K Williams., Feeling like a relic from the wave of 90s crime ensembles that followed in Tarantinos wake, Arkansas not only squanders some good talent, its a tragic waste of a fine book., As a collection of smart-mouthed southern neer-do-wells, Arkansas amuses, but as a showcase for colourful 70s menswear, it excels., With its brooding tone of tired inevitability, his Arkansas knows exactly how to find drama and sentiment in what could otherwise just be a dour path to the inevitable., Its quirky, lively, and diverting for a little while, but then it really just drags., Clark Duke shows some promise as a director and maybe even more so as a screenwriter, but it goes on too long, it is unevenly paced, and it seems to end a few times., Somehow it does have a sort of distinctive tang... It doesnt quite add up to a full meal despite being overlong, but it has a kind of ambling, affectionate weirdness to it., Less a mob thriller than a ruminative drama about a life built around orders and betrayals, the movie takes an unusual perspective on a familiar genre but is weighed down by its dull, uneven pace., Most of all it is unexpectedly fun, drawing you through its world of not-very-good-at-this criminals, low-lifes and people who want little more than to just hang about with verve and panache. And that makes it a place worth visiting., While Arkansas is a promising and often very entertaining first feature, Duke doesnt combine these borrowed ingredients-excellent though they are-into a fully realized original story, with its own personality., No matter the size of the screen or the corniness of dialogue, Arkansas proves that strong acting from game performers can make even the most harebrained of endeavors brim with vitality and necessity., If narrative drive is your thing, steer clear of Clark Dukes trifling whatzit about drug-dealing deadbeats, but pandemic-weary audiences might just revel in a southern-fried, comic randomness that becomes the films saving grace., Not everything here works, including some lead casting. But this daylight noir should please viewers willing to roll along with a crime meller more interested in character quirks than action thrills., Arkansas doesnt usually look like much (lots of music video lighting), and is often over-edited., The films insistence on keeping the stakes low throughout is probably its key strength., Arkansas doesn\t break the mold on cheeky, stylish, low-life movies; rather, it worships it., While it\s hard to watch Arkansas and not see its debt to the Coen brothers, Duke finds a voice of his own in quiet, deadpan absurdities and southern-fried eccentricities., Underwhelming, despite a surprising abundance of talent., Most of Arkansas... just falls flat, despite individual scenes here and there that work."
Coffee & Kareem,0,"The brand of humour relies on shock value, but every now and then it will hit you with something clever that comes along like a slice of pizza in the middle of a low carb diet., A profoundly irritating, cacophonous mess., Things quickly escalate into chaos and stay there, but they do so in ways that are not quite funny enough to make you forget the implausibilities or the way serious stuff is played for bad jokes., Its uneven start isnt enough to make it a total miss., Its pungently offensive and bracingly violent, but this Detroit-set action comedy is also blessed with a sharp script by Shane Mack and a weirdly likeable central pair., Coffee & Kareem is messy, but its an interesting sort of gross chaos., Coffee & Kareem is DOA., Ones a cop who cant shoot straight! Ones a kid with a nose for trouble! Together... they lack the wit, thrills and rapport to deliver fun genre times., There just isnt much of a movie here, or even much of an homage movie when you compare it to its clear influences like 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon., Theres a better movie buried underneath the many corpses in the crude and confused Netflix comedy Coffee & Kareem, one of their algorithmically assembled weekend options patchworked together from a stack of search terms., Everything goes stupefyingly wrong in this crime against comedy that features Ed Helms and Taraji P. Henson straining so hard for laughs that never come that you think director Michael Dowse was holding a gun to their heads., The biggest problem with Coffee & Kareem is no one is likable, least of all Gardenhigh\s character, whose tough-talking, off-putting exterior isn\t masking any inner insecurities. The kid\s just a jerk., Coffee & Kareem has a sweet premise at its core, with the two polar opposites tied together on a crazy quest, but its gets bogged down in its mission to shock and appall., Do the people who made Coffee & Kareem think that its a refreshing throwback? How can they not know that these kinds of movies happen all the time, and sometimes even make sense?, Coffee and Kareem is stuck in decaf mode., Although its lame-pun title is a tip-off, it still won\t prepare you for the 88 irretrievable minutes of your life that is the barrel-bottom action-comedy Coffee & Kareem., Theres politically incorrect, and then theres just plain wrong., Making a film that feels two days long is not the same thing as making 48 Hrs., A funny action comedy that comes into your house in a good mood and gets the reaction its supposed to get: laughs., So padded with bad jokes (many of which are homophobic), aimlessly vulgar language and hackneyed plot points that it makes its 88 minutes congeal beyond a recognizable measure of time."
Scoob!,0,"For a modern reboot, SCOOB! feels instantly dated. And its only contribution to the Scooby-Doo mythos is a thuddingly lame backstory to how he got his name., Theres a mannequin-like energy to the humans..., Grow? Scooby-Doo isnt supposed to grow. Hes supposed to cower and get the munchies. And that title!, Tony Cervones cheeky meddling with a franchise is inferior to James Bobins 2011 Muppets reboot, but its fun and will keep kids glued to the couch., The Great Danes big-screen return has murderous robot bowling pins, escapades in abandoned amusement parks and exciting airborne chase sequences - but nowhere near the joke-rate an enduring character like Scoob demands., It\s needlessly busy, featuring chases upon chases and cameo roles for other Hanna-Barbera properties (step forward, Dick Dastardly, voiced by Jason Isaacs)., Some of the updates to Scoob! feel like they are tailor-made for the viewing interests of todays younger audiences, but they land to varying success., Theres nothing new or interesting about this movie., Scoob! is a goofy and bright surprise - an imaginative reboot that respects its shaggy dog TV roots but is smart enough to add dashes, not shovelfuls, of wry pop-culture and movie references., Beyond the improved computer animation compared to the hand-drawn origins, sequences worthy of attention are too few and very far between., The other Hanna-Barbera characters that never quite achieved the cultural ubiquity of Scooby-Doo makes for a fun, universe-expanding tale, avoiding the cliches and story ruts that might otherwise befall yet another version of the Scooby-Doo story., Its really no better or worse than other selections from the genre its part of - that slice of fast-paced, brightly colored kids movie that makes no pretense of being anything other than an adequate distraction for young attention spans., Pre-sold fans - especially fans with kids - of Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and the thud named Fred are in the bag. I dont know what to tell the rest of you., A confounding and convoluted origin story to a pretty straightforward Saturday morning cartoon., If youre a long time fan of the brand, there might not be enough fun and also depth here to really make it satisfying., Any hopes one might have of the film exceeding the low expectations set by its unnecessarily punctuated title should be abandoned forthwith., It tries to do a little too much and runs too long but its an affable mix of nostalgia and family-friendly animated action/adventure., A ham-fisted attempt to capture the zeitgeist by shoving most of the classic characters to the side and adding a bunch of superheroes into the mix., The result is something too confusing and scary for young viewers, and too familiar and repetitive for older kids., Traditional enough to please the fans but contemporary enough to address (Im not kidding) toxic masculinity and some nice reminders about the importance of friendship."
After We Collided,0,"A series of half-digested movie tropes regurgitated by Google Rom-dram., American Afternators will no doubt be similarly pleased with this slightly campier continuation of the series. For everyone else, however, there\s not enough innovation to make the second installment a worthwhile jumping-on point., Too moronic to work as a serious romantic drama and too boring to work as straightforward sleaze., After was merely awful. After We Collided is atrocious."
The King of Staten Island,0,"Every time he makes a film these days, its as if Apatow got carried away at the pick-and-mix and walked off without realising the bag has split., It\s a film full of characters who have to say I\m sorry a lot. Bottom line, though-they\re all quite recognizably and vibrantly human., If youre prepared to give Davidson a chance, Apatows entertainment instincts and a well-chosen supporting cast are enough to ensure the film never becomes an outright drag., Viewers familiar with Davidsons role as a similar good-natured yet immature loafer in 2019s Big Time Adolescence may find the typecasting unoriginal, but the fact of the matter is this: its a type Davidson shines in., ...when youve got a character like Davidsons Scott... you cant expect, if Apatow trusts us as viewers, that were going to get some totally inspirational transformation..., It works best as a tale of flawed men struggling to navigate a new world of #MeToo and mental health awareness whilst tackling the ghosts of their fathers expectations. And the uplifting pay-off is diligently worked for, even if its a long while coming., The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes., A bit self-indulgent and too long...but the more I thought about it, the further I was from the film...the more stinging pathos moments came to mind...I thought it had a heart, tangible and beating..., In the latter half of the film, Apatow finally starts to home in on the point of his tale, and thats when The King of Staten Island becomes compelling and moving., All loose limbs and exposed emotional scar tissue, Davidson is persuasively raw in a performance that becomes increasingly textured and interesting..., I dont feel like this is the lightning in a bottle magic that some of director Judd Apatows films have been... But its enjoyable, if too long., There is a fascinating push-pull at the center of this, where Pete Davidson almost breaks out of the Judd Apatow template and makes a movie that feels interesting on its own., While eminently enjoyable, the film has a slightly loose and lazy quality. Storylines appear and then are forgotten for long stretches. Though the elements are individually solid, the fit between them is awkward., Judd Apatow has a history of hyper-reflexivity, turning his films into ruminations on his own world. His latest Pete Davidson-led project, though, suggests a conscious effort to change..., My reaction to Judd Apatows latest men-behaving-badly and in dire need of psychological help dramatic comedy hybrid The King of Staten Island can be summed up in three simple words: I didnt care., By the end, in truth, I found myself swamped by Scott, and wondered if he might have made more impact as a secondary character..., Within the scattered narrative, its Powleys Kelsey who comes out the winner, and the most realized character in the film... Shes the queen of this world, its the movie thats focused on the wrong member of the kingdom., While Apatow is a Hollywood powerhouse, The King of Staten Island\\ doesn\t come across as standard Hollywood product. It registers as a piece of personal filmmaking on the part of both director and star., Davidson is an exceptionally appealing performer, and it is clear he is trying to blend art and life here, using the film itself to become more vulnerable and more present., Pete Davidson plays a version of himself in this shaggy, endearing, if overlong, comedy."
Clouds ,0,"Big on hugs and scant on plot, the gentle, hazy script is jolted by dramatic moments that are quickly ushered away unresolved as if to shrug, thats life., Clouds has all the makings of a profound and powerful heart-tugger. So why isn\t it more wholly moving and cathartic?, Clouds continues to prove that director Justin Baldoni has a real passion and knack for sharing challenging true stories while honoring the real people and inspiring others in the process., This film is particularly perceptive on the issue of what it means to try to be normal under excruciatingly painful circumstances., A sweet, smoothed-over biopic of teenage singer-songwriter Zach Sobiech, who died aged 18 of cancer, shortly after scoring the viral folk-pop hit that lends the film its title., Clouds keeps its focus squarely on the ground from start to finish, and it soars that much higher for it., Director Justin Baldonis young-adult romance knows exactly which audience its playing to, and accomplishes much of what it sets out to do: break your heart, while leaving you humming a sorrowful-yet-catchy tune."
The Spine of Night,0,"The Spine Of Night is here to satiate the cravings of those who miss a particular brand of animated storytelling, updated with added psychedelic fervour and plenty of extra-gnarly bloodshed., A heady, fizzy mix that’s very watchable, probably even more so for viewers open to the use of chemical assistance., Spine is a throwback to the go-for-broke days of Heavy Metal, but unlike that multistoried fantasy this one tells a cohesive tale., The Spine of Night feels like a heroic mash note to the formerly frowned-upon taboo of watching this sort of black light/van art epic, only its now a couple decades later, and not at all better., Ditto the Bakshi-perfect animation, which transports you back to a time when stuff like this still felt dangerous., Alas, all the world-building filmmakers may contrive doesnt count for much if they dont put it across visually. And this heavily rotoscoped vision does not get where it needs to be to achieve genuine trippiness., With its fusion of naive, old-school character rotoscoping and lavishly airbrushed world-building, the films visuals aim squarely for geek nostalgia and hit their target., There is very little in terms of actual plot or pathos, but thats not why you watch this film., Writer/directors Philip Gelatt and Morgan Galen King understand that myth cycles are often awkward, disjointed, disconnected in a narrative sense but unified on a thematic level - and thats where The Spine of Night finally finds form., This is hard fantasy, made by people who clearly know and love the form., Even if its winding narrative structure and themes wont be for all tastes, its impossible not to be awed by the sheer artistry on display. The painstaking process of hand-rotoscoped animation gives a striking, epic feel to an ambitious concept., The Spine Of Night takes paying tribute to formative influences to some pretty impressive heights., In The Spine of Night, guts explode with a speed and velocity equaled only by how fast this movie blows our minds; audacious, dazzling and fierce, this is fantasy filmmaking with no limits., A hugely ambitious and bizarrely charming display of rotoscoped evil and carnage. The Spine of Night cant quite support its scattershot anthology narrative, but the themes and bold visuals make it engaging enough., Heroes seem bored whether its maleficence or magnificence that falls before them. So, while intellectually enticing and visually daring, the dogged dryness leaves a curious tale emotionally bereft."
How It Ends ,0,"The comedy worked for me fitfully; the drama didnt work for me at all., An amiable and appealing little comedy. Its sweet, sometimes a little melancholy, and sometimes hopeful., The film plays as a series of perfectly enjoyable sketches strung together, an excuse for veteran actors to chew on playful dialogue., The comedy is pitched at such a low volume that its difficult to hear., Even at a relatively brief 82 minutes, many viewers may find themselves checking their watches and wondering what could possibly be keeping that meteor., The end-of-the-world genre has enjoyed some new beginnings of late. How It Ends is one of the more thoughtful and fun of these one-way tickets., For all the indie-film grimacing humor, for all the celebs packed in for socially distanced scenes, the film succeeds most when the camera is on Liza and her younger self as they navigate the tension of trying to be alone with yourself., The film is so economical in its momentum, and its tone of comic wistfulness so uniform, that its string of tableaux rarely feels jerky., The laughs may be fleeting in How It Ends but they can be mighty cathartic., Its a pleasant enough hangout movie, and someday it may be held up as a slanted portrait of what mid-2020 felt like for people privileged enough to ignore politics. But it still feels like a minor movie in the face of a major catastrophe., Its a little meandering in structure but there is a feeling of real heart in the films idiosyncrasies and glimmers of standout comedy in Lister-Jones and Spaenys deadpan delivery., With all due apologies to the plants, animals, and 7.5bn other souls about to be incinerated in a doomsday fireball, #teammeteor., If you ever found yourself staring at an old childhood photograph, scrutinizing what your younger self was thinking in that moment, the idiosyncratically existential comedy How It Ends will leave a bittersweet aftertaste., With its sprightly take on doomsday, How It Ends might be a pandemic movie for the stage of the pandemic where it\s possible to see some hope., Lister-Jones has the precise bearing and tone to ground something this wacky and outsized, and she approaches the part with her usual blithe charm., Packed with cameos from seemingly every celebrity the writer/directors have befriended during their careers, its more breezy than bittersweet, more about acceptance and forgiveness than a movie made in 2020 has any right to be."
Bad Trip ,0,"Theres another, deeper achievement here, which is how dexterously Bad Trips half-verite concept exposes and crosses the wires of so many mainstream gross-out and/or romantic comedies..., As if to counteract the bummer of watching a raucous comedy on Netflix... Bad Trip comes equipped with its own crowd energy-a collective faith that theres no idiotic stunt that cant be pulled back from the brink of disaster., Its a delivery system for strung-together Situationist happenings, a fancy way of saying that everyday people get co-opted into highly elaborate, hilarious, smart-comics-doing-dumb-gross sh*t., Its a blunt instrument of absurdity, but thats also what makes it so much fun., Thirty years ago, these incidents may have provoked interesting reactions. Now, people just see them as opportunities for their own content., Bad Trip might be a dumb, gross candid-camera comedy, but dont be surprised if it makes you feel a little better about your world., Despite its dead ends, Bad Trip is a ridiculously fun ride., Sniggering slapstick thats two-parts biological fluids and one-part salute to the innate empathy of mankind, often in the same scene., Bad Trip knows how to stir things up, and its funniest scenes often involve real people getting in the mix, tested by the brilliant skills of André, Howery, and Haddish., If it makes you laugh (and I mean really makes you laugh) as it often did me, that can be salve enough., As you enjoy the movies gleeful outrageousness, take a moment to appreciate the strategic sophistication of some of these bits., After the laughs have died down, these jerry-rigged gotchas all seem modest in ambition, offering little more than surprise., Bad Trip is actually two films in one, although the whole definitely adds up to less than the sum of the parts., Funny in spots, but it flatlines early and gets way too gross., Bad Trip has the blithe advantage of the easygoing complementary personalities at its center., However effortful, the movies tricks are more likely to activate your gorge than your funny bone."
Pig ,0,"If you have an open mind, you will be rewarded with a melancholic and poignant story, and a superb, triumphant performance from Cage who has no trouble reminding audiences that he is an Oscar winner capable of incredible range and depth., There are few actors who could pull off this tonal balancing act as successfully as Cage... Over the years, some have questioned how far hes in on his own joke -- but at this point, theres no doubting his finely tuned sense of the ridiculous., A deeply moving film with twists and turns that few could see coming, Pig is - amongst other things - a timely reminder of just how good Nicolas Cage is at his job., Though the film is teed up as a kind of John Wick-style revenge bender, Cages star persona is soon smartly subverted., Pig shouldnt be a revelation to anyone whos been following these mens careers, but its a perfect reminder of how easily we can underestimate people., Action-packed and yet gently meditative., His most contemplative performance in years, a reminder of a time when David Lynch hailed Cage as the jazz musician of American acting., This is the movie for which the term sui generis was invented., Anyone whos been keeping faith with Nicolas Cage, through all his careers snaking cul-de-sacs and mad escapades, has a tremendous reward in store when they sit down to Pig., Cage is as mesmeric as ever, showing off his chops, as it were, with a slow performance to match a story about a character devoted to slow food and locavore authenticity., An outstanding debut. Pair with wine and someone you love., Quiet, unforced and delicate, Pig provides a forum for Nicolas Cage, one of our most dazzling showmen, to get serious and burrow more deeply into his talent than he has in years., Photographed in the way of so many modern indies, with a sickly color palette and dim lighting that prosaically emphasizes the natural environs over people\s faces. (A good friend of mine termed this aesthetic Vimeo-link Cinema.), Pig is set in the world of foodies, but it is an Americana fable with a much broader moral..., Cage is magnificent. This is a restrained, intuitively measured portrait of a lost man rediscovering forgotten facets of himself as he goes on this surreal trek through a world he left in the rearview mirror ages ago., The character that Cage portrays is incoherent, illustrative, and ludicrous, and yet his portrayal makes the movie., Cage offers something genuinely special: a perfect performance, and one which could not exist without every other performance that the actor has ever delivered., A bittersweet and often surprisingly tender exploration of food, creative expression, and human connection., An odd but very effective and evocative character study., Pig is a thoughtful, well-made movie for an audience primed for junk: It\s pearls before swine."
Fear Street Part Two: 1978,0,"So much of the trilogy is dedicated to expositional scenes laying down the foundations of Shadysides history, theres too much thats admirable in theory and flat on screen., As love letters to 1970s and 80s slashers go, this is one of the best Ive seen outside of 2015s The Final Girls., Compared with 1994, in 1978, the kills were more shocking, the atmosphere more tense, the characters more believable and well-rounded, and the world-building more thoughtful., As far as the summer camp genre goes, this is one of the better ones., Heres the bottom line: these are good, well-acted, well-written R.L. Stein plots., 1978 lags in comparison to its lead-in, bogged down by repetitive exposition and expending too much effort cultivating an air of intrigue around whats ultimately a pretty straightforward mythology., Plays like Scream meets Stranger Things built on a supernatural premise sturdy enough to sustain interest and suspense over nearly six hours., If 1994s escalating events seemed more like a string of bad luck, 1978s feel like people genuinely at the mercy of cruel, coordinated fate thanks to sins of the past., A darker middle act, Fear Street Part Two: 1978 lacks the verve of 1994 but still delivers enjoyable summer camp-based bedlam., Its a horror film lovingly tailored to the tastes of those who grew up on Stines work, including his famous Goosebumps books, and have since uncovered all that the genre has to offer those with a feral imagination and a strong stomach., The characters too are complex and skilfully performed. Its just a shame that this time the big horror set pieces are so devoid of irony and so brutally violent., This is horror done extremely well., Its thematic concerns and adding of dimension to the trilogys story lift it above average genre fare. In this case, the first cut was definitely not the deepest., 1978 is a frustrating bummer -- a summer camp slasher thats afraid of campiness, and one thatd be a better fit for group therapy sessions than sleepovers., Leigh Janiak continues her streak with another solid R-rated slasher that delivers brutal kills and likable characters that make those deaths hurt., Yet 1994 set a high bar that 1978 can\t quite reach. It\s a slow ride that should have been a cherry bomb., After such a strong first chapter, Part 2 feels a tad underwhelming but its still a wicked good time., Again, so much of what makes this work is an extraordinarily talented group of young actors who take the silliness of the witchs curse and sell it with heartfelt conviction., Though never quite rising to the level of its most overt influences, the film is lent a certain gravitas by the sense that all of this has happened before and will undoubtedly happen again., Part 2 is its own exhilarating adventure that showcases a dynamic cast of characters and revels in lots and lots of bloody murder."
Licorice Pizza,0,"... As perversely delicious as its title., Really stands up alongside (Anderson’s best work). It feels authentic for the time, and gives us a new star in Cooper Hoffman , Licorice Pizza, like Phantom Thread, is a study of magnetic human connection that isn’t necessarily good for either party — but then, magnetic human connection rarely thinks that way, or thinks at all. , It’s a joy, and the sort of film that like a great LP -- it’s named after a Californian record store -- you’ll want to play over and over., Theres a looseness  a dreaminess, an illogic  to how it all unfolds and meanders that is somehow still incredibly authentic., The two leads, musician Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman, each in their feature film debut, are remarkable., Licorice Pizza takes an arms-length embrace of nostalgia. Anderson doesnt turn a blind eye to reality-he heightens it, weighting it with meaning, reflecting the romance of hindsight and adolescent abandon., One thing I really like about this movie is the way its structured, because its meandering and its loose but all these little moments, they feel like stories and anecdotes and memories that have been told and recounted many times., Anderson and Haim, with her sharp-elbowed and funny yet soulful performance, capture the flailing, directionless condition of being a woman in her mid-20s., This is a film carried by two people whove basically never acted before, but Anderson somehow knew that they could, and neither hits a false note in over two hours. Its a star-crossed love story à la Harold and Maude minus the tragedy., This film - which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture - will command a second (and third) watch., Gary is played by Cooper Hoffman, the teenage son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and hes captivating, full of chutzpah and with such a good, imperfect, real face., Like any LP worth its salt, this is one where youll want to be dropping the needle on over and over again., The twists and turns in the script seems desultory. That is, until you realise the whole point of Licorice Pizza is to demonstrate that most heterosexual adult males suck., This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucass American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge., The fullest expression yet of a certain kind of narrative antipathy that has crept into Andersons toolkit and almost overwhelmed his last outing, the frequently dreadful Phantom Thread., One can scarcely imagine a more enjoyably chaotic way of welcoming in the new year. What a blast., Such is the energy Anderson whips up, forever sending in chaos from the edge of the frame. The result is a giddy freewheel in which scenes never end how you or the characters expect, and whats coming next is anyones guess., The things in Licorice Pizza that are so good, like the performances from Haim and Hoffman and Cooper and the period fidelity, make you wish that the entire movie was just as good., Looser and funnier than his recent efforts, sharper and more formally assured than his earliest films, this is Paul Thomas Anderson operating at full capacity. A master at work."
Redeeming Love ,0,"This movie thinly scatters a parable’s worth of plot across 134 minutes and resembles HBO’s Deadwood recut for Sunday-school purposes: pious, puzzling and punitive, with a sternly wagging finger never far from entering the frame., Redeeming Love could have tried to reach a broader audience but settles for preaching to the choir., Love might be best embraced by the faithful, but it is well made and has much to say about the healing power of love and how we all deserve second chances., Redeeming Love is like the most expensive community theatre production youve ever seen. The acting is just not there., It\s so hard to shake the lingering icky feelings about this text, which plays like tradwife fan fiction, the 19th-century setting protecting the story from the pesky women\s lib movement, which would suggest that Angel have her own autonomy., Theres something icky about this love story., The film is too narrow-minded to explore the notion that a saint-like man may want to satisfy his normal carnal desires."
Hollywood Stargirl,0,"Grace VanderWaal returns as the infectiously sweet singer, now starstruck and lovestruck., As with “Stargirl,” there’s a bone-deep decency to this sequel that’s pretty disarming., A suitably quirky and sweet sequel that builds on the Stargirl mythos with nothing but good intentions. , How do you build a story around a character who was auxiliary by design? Hart’s solutions are manifold, but her most effective one is to quash the grating altruism that drove Stargirl in the first movie., Director Julia Hart has quietly crafted a Disney+ franchise that continues to unfold in creative and charming ways. It’s a meaningful love letter to the artistic, creative process, dedicated to dreamers with unwavering ambition."
The School for Good and Evil ,0,"The movie really is star-studded, but it has almost no momentum. , It’s too nakedly derivative and too crudely assembled (Feig is hardly a visual stylist). Yet the central conceit is consistently compelling... , An exhaustingly long, overstuffed movie that probably would’ve worked better as a TV series., This is the starting point for a lot of enjoyably intricate silliness, which incorporates makeovers, magical duels, shout-outs to Lewis Carroll and Little Shop of Horrors, and some impressively bold puberty metaphors., The School for Good and Evil ends with the promise of further chapters, but I’d be OK with closing the book without turning any more pages.\n\n, Harry Potter meets Descendants with a dash of Romeo and Juliet in The School for Good and Evil. And yes, it is as overstuffed as that sounds., Pretty much all the young actors here must own a lot of crypto, since they certainly have nothing to do with any gold standard., Like so many of Netflix’s costlier recent productions, it seems built primarily as an in-house imitation of a popular blockbuster brand – something to go at the top of the search results when ‘Harry Potter’ comes up blank., Feig’s film is nowhere near as fully realized or as creatively satisfying as I kept hoping it was going to be, making The School for Good and Evil a mixed bag of magic tricks., Mostly, there’s a tired, by-the-numbers quality to much of what transpires, even if the underlying lessons seek to expand on the familiar notions of heroism and love. , The School for Good and Evil is never as much of an eyesore as the latter-day Tim Burton movies that appear to have inspired it, but its garish colors and flagrantly foul CGI wizardry only contribute to the movie’s pervasive tackiness., An absolute shambles of a fantasy folly. Overlong, undercooked, and clogged with enough clichés that even its teen target audience will feel disrespected., Until someone figures out how to innovate on delivering the shiny, “pew pew!” magic required of action-fantasy YA and its ilk, properties like this one will fail to distinguish themselves., A muddle of clichés and inconsistencies with just enough charm and cleverness to keep you watching., Teaches the object lesson that conjuring a phenomenon on par with Harry Potter isn’t as simple as scribbling on a cocktail napkin., Sure, it’s a “Harry Potter” rip-off, but had Feig taken the time to let the film breathe, it might have stood on its own., This is a uniquely tiresome slog — madly over-plotted, thuddingly derivative, insanely overlong and slathered in a big symphonic score that strives to infuse momentum into a saga with minimal emotional stakes., Together, the young actors take this project beyond good and evil, into the realm of something real."
The 355,0,"What The 355 offers up is a perfect Saturday afternoon dad movie, but instead of starring Stallone or Eastwood or Bronson, it stars five women with six Oscar nominations and two wins between them. (And was written by the creator of NBCs Smash!), This 124-minute movie is fast-paced, well-acted and asks some interesting questions about where one’s loyalty lies., This simplistic approach, which forces an evil/ethical binary, paired with a ham-fisted dialogue, flattens the film and makes the lulls between fight scenes feel more like retribution than respite., If youve ever seen a mediocre action movie with a surprisingly stacked cast, then youve basically seen this., Theres nothing here that Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson havent done already but Kinberg and his nimble cast achieve such momentum that youll probably shelve your reservations until its all over., Doggedly mediocre actioner The 355 is the cinematic equivalent of gathering together Formula 1s finest drivers and tossing them the keys to a Yugo., An often generic but surprisingly engaging espionage action/thriller., This is a title that screams, Watch me at home!, Diane Kruger slapping Jessica Chastain across the face with a frozen fish should be funny., Its dullness somehow feels worse than grand failure, as though its aims were only to prove that a bunch of the most famous women on Earth can come together to make an action film just as uninspired and boring as men can., The 355 boasts exactly one genuinely suspenseful scene (it happens around the 3/4 point) but that lasts only about five minutes and therefore represents less than 5% of the overall running time., Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyongo, Penelope Cruz among the great talents insulting the audiences intelligence., It is pure catnip for fans of the genre of beautiful women fighting off the bad guys with aplomb, These women are dazzling and working so hard in such a derivative secret agent actioner., It plays like a press conference made uninteresting flesh. No sooner endured than forgotten., Yes, Chastain makes for a kinetic action hero, as do a few of her co-stars, and shes someone who most assuredly puts her money where her mouth is. But no, this is not the all-female Bond franchise youre looking for., Mostly, The 355 succeeds where others have come up short because it put the movie and the story first -- not the message., The 355 devolves into a bullet-spattered endurance test., The 355 amasses some of the most talented and electrifying actresses in the world, then squanders them in a generic and forgettable action picture., If you can turn your brain off for two hours and cast the horrifying politics and Kinberg problems aside, The 355 is a pretty enjoyable and ridiculous popcorn flick."
Where the Crawdads Sing ,0,"The PG-13-ness of Where the Crawdads Sing buffs every rough edge off this story—the abuse, the abandonment, the betrayal, the sex, and even the alleged murder. It would be better off as trash., Edgar-Jones’ easygoing allure isn’t enough to bind Where the Crawdads Sing together, though, leaving the film a generic, dull outing., This film is like the Instagram-influencer version of Beasts of a Southern Wild — a Goop post about its beautifying effects., A flat, flair-free and uninspiring adaptation., Like the backdrop – marsh or swamp – it’s all a bit soggy., A fairly engrossing entertainment -- a little bit slick and doesnt go in depth into the marsh. , Newman’s vision of rural South Carolina is scrubbed so clean you might as well call it #swampcore., ... Even Edgar-Jones, at times firing on all cylinders as enfant sauvage Kya Clark, can’t quite save this much-hyped adaptation from an overdose of syrup and some deeply dubious subtext., Everything feels both fussy and perfunctory, and not a bit of it real., Overall one can’t help but notice that Newman’s adaptation feels too clean, too glossy and too neatly packed to be in any way plausible, even with a fair amount of suspension of disbelief., I’d rather eat a box of Caran d’Ache pencils than rewatch this mess., The book’s cliches have won out and all the literary elements that made it unique have completely evaporated. Film is remorseless when it comes to stripping a novel down to its essentials., You never feel Kya’s connection to her environment, even though I’m guessing that should be of utmost importance. For a film about what it is to be wild it’s incredibly tame. Plus you don’t even encounter any crawdads., Box-fresh and laundered to a fault, the blandly attractive characters spend their time wandering along shorelines as if in an evasive American television commercial for prescription incontinence medicine., A run-of-the-mill drama would be acceptable to many audiences who are looking for a diverting couple of hours, but it’s not going to cut it when the source material is so beloved,, Plays like an all-white reboot of To Kill a Mockingbird with Edgar-Jones somehow getting to play Scout and Tom Robinson at the same time. And the big twist ending is an outrageously evasive cheat., There are a host of other things wrong with the film, from poor pacing, to a lack of character depth, to heavy-handed themes...but Jones does her best with what she has to work with, and it may still strike an emotional chord if they don’t look closely., This 125-minute movie feels longer than that., Slow, almost lazy, gothic kind of feel to it and I just wish it had more. , Kya’s world is so toothless and the aesthetic so rote that it feels like the creation of a committee of Instagrammers."
1Up ,0,"The script reads like an early draft of an Ernst Cline novel, with mile-a-minute nerd references that are meant to cover the thin ready-bake stereotypes that make up the 8-Bits. "
Better Nate Than Ever ,0,"His leads deliver hearty performances that elevate the movie, particularly once weve had time to adjust to the gusto of Wood, whose wired performance has the flavor of Hugh Jackmans exuberance squeezed into an espresso cup., Smart, fun, funny, and a great movie to share with the family., “Nate” might not surprise you in its structure, but it has pleasant surprises up its gleeful sleeve and a heart as big as the Big Apple., Funny, vibrant, yet schmaltzy to a fault, this Disney Plus family film can carry a tune."
Hellraiser ,0,"What works most about the new Hellraiser are its leads. Odessa A’zion’s performance makes up for a lot of what the script lacks., The elaborate new Cenobite designs owe as much to Guillermo del Toro’s bioclockwork as Barker’s S&M body mods, but yet again the emissaries of Hell stand around being philosophically evil rather than doing much of anything., Odessa Azion is just wonderful., Pinhead and The Lament Configuration bring no pleasure, only pain., There’s something lacking. For all the flayed flesh and impaled skin in the picture, this “Hellraiser” isn’t sharp enough., Gestures at similar ideas and borrows familiar plot points but makes the classic reboot mistake of adding too much story to what should have been a more concentrated reimagining of the Pinhead universe., Hellraiser is slick and stylish, but it feels like the ultimate studio-sanctioned version of a transgressive series., This is a phenomenal continuation of Barker’s story, one that pays deft homage to both the source material and the original two films while also expanding the mythology in emotionally complex and dramatically unsettling ways., Bruckners Hellraiser evokes Barker’s original adaptation in the same way a good cover song recalls its source material: with love, intelligence, and an inevitably crushing sort of redundancy., What Bruckner does justify... is the sheer existence of his remake, an extremely hard thing to do, with enough visual verve and stomach-turning sadism to satiate the Halloween crowd., This direct-to-Hulu version offers a credibly creepy retelling in an over-inflated package that would benefit from a few targeted pinpricks., As an ambitious allegory for the chaos and torment of addiction, “Hellraiser” works mainly because of A’zion, who gives her scattered character a deeply human desperation., A 2022 rebirth for the franchise, free of all the sexy subversion that got it here in the first place. It’s perfectly entertaining, using Barker’s inventive tropes to tell a solidly gory nightmare, but it’s a pale vanilla shadow of the original., Hellraiser 2022 easily clears the admittedly low bar of being one of the best Hellraiser movies., Hellraiser infuses enough style and worldbuilding with a mesmerizing new Hell Priest to ensure we’re ready to sign up for whatever other sights Bruckner has to show us next., Bruckner, Collins, and Piotrowski plant their vision in fields that are no less rich, terrifying, or gorily violent than the hellbound story that started it all., The new “Hellraiser” works as metaphor, as flesh-annihilating spectacle. Yet it doesn’t quite work as a story., Fans will be relieved to know that this Hellraiser definitely doesn’t skimp on the gore, providing enough viscera and flayed skin to satisfy the most bloodthirsty viewers., Embodying Clive Barker’s original intention of “repulsive glamour,” these Cenobites silently glide on hell’s runway. The assignment was “red flesh and raw meat, but make it fashion,” and their work is an elegant slam dunk., David Bruckner’s Hellraiser reboot is a toothlessly retrograde enterprise.\n\n"
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,0,"The sequence of events that take place in this film just dont build up to anything that feels like it matters..., Its very clear, watching these movies, that theyre adapted from a branded guidebook. They have all the dramatic interest and excitement of a manual., This entertaining Harry Potter prequel buries memories of the Grindelwald disaster., While perhaps the best Fantastic Beasts film, The Secrets of Dumbledore remains a dour movie with lots to say but not enough imagination or understanding to say it well., Even taken on its own merits, its a case of a sequel too far Theres no getting away from the fact that, without Harry Potter, this (movie) doesnt seem to know where to go. , This one may well be better than “Where to Find Them,” which was a mite busy for its own good. Kicking off a franchise can have that effect., If the series were to fizzle out, that would be a relief. No amount of movie magic can save it now., To my mind, the movie needs to be entertaining on its own. These movies are not -- theyre displays of wizardry, if you forgive the pun. , While The Secrets of Dumbledore is miles from ideal, it at least clears the bar of not leaving a foul, confusing taste like its immediate predecessor., It’s time to bid farewell to Dumbledore and his associates, students, proteges, and enemies., Avada Kedavra!, We’re supposed to be witnessing an epic battle between good and evil, but it’s a contest between energy and entropy, and entropy carries the dreary day.\n\n, Like The Crimes of Grindelwald, Secrets of Dumbledore is handsomely done but ultimately too much of a dumble-snore. And somehow, its appealing pieces, old and new, again add up to a less-than-magical movie., No one involved in these movies seems to have any idea what their appeal is supposed to be., Enchantment still beckons in the third of J.K. Rowlings planned five film prequel to Harry Potter, but this flagging franchisebeset with controversies among its creative teamslogs when it most needs to soar., The Secrets of Dumbledore has its moments, but the sum is oddly less than its parts., It relies on a level of knowledge about the Harry Potter cinematic universe that does not make this two and a half-hour movie easy for viewers who are not as familiar with the characters., We served with Harry Potter, we knew Harry Potter, he was a friend of ours. And you, Newt Scamander, are no Harry Potter. ,  An alternate subtitle could be Totalitarianism for Tykes., Third time\s a charm for the Fantastic Beasts series, which took three tries to — finally — produce something that feels like a complete movie."
Predators ,0,"This movie doesnt really know how to be its own film., No over-the-top acting, not a really compelling plotline, but entertaining yet., The real enemy is too much exposition., Nowhere near as thoughtful as the original, but between the impressive set design, upgraded enemies, battle sequences and gore, itll satiate your appetite for Predator action., A big-budget B-movie made with some A-level flair., The drive-in -- and all that it entrails -- awaits., The odor of musty, late-80s nostalgia may still hover around this already threadbare brand, but you simply dont see movies that leave both the curious and the fans who truly care this viscerally satisfied anymore., Antal is a good enough action director that some of the combat is pretty exciting., At the midpoint... it got more and more confined, claustrophobic and flatter., Almost a quarter-century after the B-movie that launched an improbable franchise, we get a reboot that simply spins it wheels, content to deliver exactly what most will expect from it and absolutely nothing more., None of this is scary, and nothing makes sense., There isnt anything as comically grisly as the exploding head or Carl Weathers arm removal, both well-remembered moments from the original Predator., Predators needed more predators., It has fun showing us that humans can, indeed, be the most dangerous game., Predators mostly just suggests a bunch of grown-up men playing with toys and not bothering to invite the rest of us into their circle., Some genre movies simply work out this way: Whatever their intentions or origins they percolate for about an hour. And then they sputter and hope that a promising first half will be enough to get by., The dialogue is dumber than dirt, and the plot crumbles at the halfway mark, but the movie does what a loud summer blockbuster should, which is loudly bust blocks., A stylish, lean and, well, familiar outing., This chaotic stew of fire, blood, mud and explosives is so devoid of terror and suspense that any metaphorical analysis is rendered moot., Predators is just another movie-machine, running on action formula."
Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,0,"The Greek gods had outsized powers and petty grievances. These Gen-Y demigods are no different - its a whole generation of kids with daddy issues, I thought it was mischievous and witty and amusing and I was just sort of drawn into it., Kids will love it, and adults may relish Pierce Brosnans Centaur, and Steve Coogan as Hades - in his personal hell just under Hollywood., A slab of market research in search of an actual movie., Digitisation reigns - spectacular visual effects - while the dialogue drizzles and sploshes., If theyd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul., The story is told in bland, episodic fashion with no sense of drama or threat., This ineffably wooden Chris Columbus adaptation of author Rick Riordans best-seller for young teens has a screenplay that defies description., Its fantastic fun, it knows its Greek mythology, and its a very promising start to a franchise. More of the same, please., It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief\s market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults., Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the films myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter., Young viewers probably will be entertained but even they are likely to realize that this could have and should have been better, especially by the time theyre old enough to drive., Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the films dippier moments. Its his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets., Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends., Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic., Percy Jackson, you are no Harry Potter. You are not fit to walk in a hobbits wake., Harry Potter meets Clash of the Titans … The backdrop of Greek mythology makes an enjoyable change of pace from the medieval fantasy magic of the Potter stories., Harry, Ron and Hermione: Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs., The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness, all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects., Likable as Percy may be, its not lightning hes stolen."
The Social Network,0,"In its cold, almost forensic way, this is as tense and exciting as it is absorbing. Its a miracle, really., The Social Network, just like its subject, is the pop culture phenomenon of the new generation., Fincher does, at least, make decent entertainment out of such inherently unprepossessing subjects as computer use and legal hearings., The Social Network is splendid entertainment from a master storyteller, packed with energetic incident and surprising performances., At last, a movie you can actually discuss afterward. And not just on Facebook or Twitter. No, youll want to chew it over in person, with friends, for hours., Like Zuckerberg, Fincher excels at data management, delivering vast amounts of information with the utmost clarity and speed., Its a shamelessly biased account, as well as a seductively plausible one, although you have to keep your wits about you to get the full effect., In his first venture over to the dark side, the central performance by Jesse Eisenberg is a revelation. Its Oscar-worthy stuff., David Finchers fast-paced business drama adopts the set-up of his 1999 film Fight Club and inverts it., Despite the fun of the parties, the intrigue of the legal wranglings and the humour of the dialogue, Fincher and Sorkin never let us forget that were complicit in their story (or at least 500 million of us are)., Business hasnt been this exciting since Gordon Gekkos first outing., A rich, understated character drama that gleefully exposes the petty playground politics at the centre of one of the internet-eras most bitter court cases., The film is almost nothing but scenes of people sitting over glowing screens, or in lawyers offices, or in bars/diners/clubs. Yet it never seems sedentary. The jabber is intensive., The Social Network is one of the movies for which 2010 will be remembered., The films real achievement stretches beyond the story. When weve all forgotten Facebook, The Social Network will remind us what it was to be part of the generation of Millenials., A business procedural played with the intensity of a thriller and the ingenuity of a screwball comedy., The movies lustrous, deep-focus frames and headlong pace are difficult to resist. Its an entertainingly cynical small movie., Finchercrafts a document that analyzes who we are now and where were at in a way no other motion picture up to now has, and for that reason alone that probable makes the film a masterpiece., You will know The Social Network is something very special from its first scene., The Social Network shares creative DNA with a handful of classic, zeitgeist-savvy films like Network and All the Presidents Men, as well as more recent fare such as The Insider and Michael Clayton."
Sex and the City 2,0,"Get a woman to write and get a woman to direct it, The sequel, Sex and the City 2, wipes any urges towards mirth. You watch in mounting disbelief as the disgruntled girls ( not women, never) come on to whinge about every single thing thats in their lives., Though the sequel doesnt pack as much juice as the original movie, Sex And The City 2 doesnt leave your martini glass empty., The featherbrained feminism the series specializes in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book (I Do. Do I?) beside Susan Sontags Against Interpretation., Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old, and, frankly, I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering, mincing, hair-tossing, eyelash-batting little-girl shtick shes been pulling ever since L.A. Story., I realize that gaudy fantasy is essential to this franchise, but why does the fantasy have to be so stunted?, Best to quit now while there are still a few bubbles left in the champagne., Sex and the City has turned into a bloated juggernaut of pointlessness. Its female characters are now beyond unbearable, none more so than Carrie., These girls are so hung up on looking great theyve forgotten there are several ways to be ugly., It takes everything that was bad about the first Sex And The City movie, and nothing that was good about the Sex And The City TV series, and mixes it together with a bit of racism to create something even worse., Lock them all up and throw away the key is what I say., If only it were two and a half hours of Liza doing Beyonce numbers. Now that would be a truly fabulous two and a half hours well spent., The most insulting and dangerous film for women since Pretty Woman. But with less charm., In the end its the fun movie its supposed to be. Raise your cosmos in a modest toast., Its an almost avant-garde adventure in aimlessness., An enervated, crass and gruesomely caricatured trip to nowhere that seems conceived primarily to find new and more cynical ways to abuse the loyalty of its audience., Remember the old, boundary-breaking, taboo-toppling Sex and the City? Forget it. Neither sex nor the city plays any role in this film., It has no plot to speak of, little in the way of wit or intelligence, and is about 50% longer than can reasonably be justified., At two and a half hours, Sex 2 -- like its predecessor -- is a long sit in the shallows, the equivalent of five half-hour episodes strung together., The moment of dread. It comes for all beloved series, and in Sex and the City 2, it arrives with embarrassing suddenness."
Norwegian Wood ,0,"Like its source material from Haruki Murakami, this is a beautiful film that exquisitely captures grief and sadness, and unsurprisingly, it probably wont help you if youre suffering from seasonal affective disorder., The acting in the film is key. Every moment by Kenichi Matsuyama as Watanabe and Rinko Kikuchi as Naoko is valid yet seems distilled by memory rather than presented raw., We cover years at a bound, but when we light, we tend to spend long, lingering moments through the cameras loving eye. This is a beautiful film to see., Tran has drained the life right out of the novel., It becomes a film that, like its characters, remains elusive in its motivations and therefore detached from its audience., A master of mood and visuals, Tran proves an inspired choice., There are sequences and situations I found myself floating into the celluloid., Its sweet all the way up, wavers in dread and slides down to doom., This lush, eventually torpid adaptation of Haruki Murakamis more nuanced 1987 cult-favorite novel considers youthful love, loss, and eros..., A visually stunning and moving piece of storytelling bolstered by searing performances and a standout score by Jonny Greenwood., Maybe this was the project Tran has been waiting for. I rate this the best film of his non-prolific career by far., It takes no significant liberties with the plot, and it captures the novels delicate, half-hopeful, half-mournful tone. So why, unlike its source material, does it feel only half-alive?, Norwegian Wood is a restrained portrait of liminal moments, a coming-of-age tale that feels more like a moody ghost story than a neatly contained chronicle of beginnings., Even for a film set in a land that considers paper folding an exciting activity, this is dull stuff., While this beautiful-looking film at times succeeds in capturing its source materials delicate emo spirit, its far less attentive to the richness of Murakamis characters., The truth is knotty in Norwegian Wood, deftly adapted by Franco-Vietnamese writer-director Tran Anh Hung from Haruki Murakamis most popular novel., Norwegian Wood registers less as a coherent narrative than as a tortuous reverie steeped in mournful yearning., Tran seems to realize that the best a filmmaker can do under these circumstances may be to substitute visual for linguistic beauty. And he has created stunning tableaux, before which the saddest of stories unfolds., Norwegian Wood is a beauteous, lukewarm bore., The film is perilously close to being an exercise in tactile but touchy-feely passive-aggression."
The Extra Man ,0,", , A drearily quirky mess., An entertaining kinky kick of a movie, a lightweight delight about dreamers and dilettantes., The Extra Man is a disappointment coming from Berman and Pulcini, whose American Splendor was an imaginative biopic about the late comic-book author Harvey Pekar., Dano and Kline are very fine performers. So why is this comedy such a chore? The answer appears to be whimsy overload., Swifter comedic timing and a clearer narrative thread might have helped center this peculiar adaptation of Jonathan Amess 1998 novel of the same name. Then again, maybe not., Pulcini & Bermans work cuts its own path through the archetypes and delivers a unique comedy in the process., Some actors are dinner. Kevin Kline is dessert, and his comic brio saves the film version of The Extra Man from its limitations., The movie aggressively pushes its whimsicality to the point where it feels less whimsical than just aggressive., Adapted from the Jonathan Ames novel, the film is too precious around the edges, but it gets somewhere., Kevin Kline tends to give bravura performances even when hes not playing bravura characters., I liked it enough to say rent it., I felt the whole movie was kind of mannered and labored., The picture revels in its own unconventionality, The Extra Man a consistently engaging curiosity even when some of its more important pieces dont quite live up to the glorious oddities surrounding them., Henry is a man who knows how to live, and Kline welcomes us into the Russian Tea Room of his mind., Darlings, theres nothing quite so tragique as a boring eccentric., Its relentlessly unwacky and even quietly subversive., Kline is his usual engaging self but its a supporting role hes playing by virtue of the script, but also Mr. Danos presence, in this potent charmer of a film., Kline has a ball, while Dano turns in a pitch-perfect performance. He never mocks his characters desires, or undersells his fears."
Jane Eyre ,0,"What it does right it does very right. It is stunningly mounted, for example... But what it does wrong is fatal, and the error is this: it just isnt passionate or sexy enough., Jane Eyre triumphs with a suitably bleak landscape and an excellent performance from Michael Fassbender, but the restrained tone lets it down., , Screenwriter Moira Buffini sticks pretty closely to the novel, and director Cary Fukunaga conjures a drab tone that nicely sets off the characters violent but rigidly controlled passions., The direction by Cary Fukunaga is real by-the-numbers rote., The new Jane Eyre is notably well-made in almost every respect and should you want to watch an adaptation of the story just now, highly recommendable., Some works of art are inexhaustible, and this is proving one of them., Spot on., Those craving gloomy stairways and thunderclap atmospherics might not come away completely sated, but Fukunagas delicate artistry leaves it hard to ask for much more., In approaching the material with respect, restraint and simple good taste, Fukunaga has created something strangely revelatory., This adaptation is balanced, crafted, beautifully acted, though for me without the thunderclap and lightning-bolt of passion., This is no plain Jane., Theres no question its stunningly mounted, and Wasikowska makes a much stronger Jane than Alice, but the romance is overripe and the climax underdone., Following his impressive feature debut, Sin Nombre, director Cary Fukunaga has brought his keen eye and humanistic sensibilities to this oft-told story., If the motion-picture industry had existed in 1847, the year Charlotte Bronts novel appeared, it might have produced an adaptation much like this one., The Eyre/Rochester romance has inspired happy sighs for 160 years and in these days, when so little is repressed that no one makes time for smolder, it still delivers., It is a movie that has delved into the nooks and crannies of the authors brain unlike any other before it that I have seen, and for that reason alone I do call it a triumph and a motion picture most definitely worth the time to experience for ones self., Somehow Wasikowska makes it all seem much more personal, more real. With her stark, starched dresses and blunt, elastic face, she draws you in, making both Janes pain and incredible resolve tangible., An atmospheric, absorbing version of the classic romance between an abandoned, plucky orphan and a wealthy, mysterious older man with a seriously Gothic secret., By opening their movie with the mature Jane, the filmmakers forge an emotional bond between her and the audience."
The Descendants,0,"I liked it. I enjoyed it. I did not resent the time Id spent watching it, although that may just be because I seriously have nothing better to do., The Descendants is humane, decent, and close to real quality., The film plays to Paynes strengths - not just the emotional complexity and the constantly shifting kaleidoscope of moods, but his skill at eliciting in-depth performances from his cast., Few films have dealt with the concept of parental death as movingly, poetically and lovingly as this, delivering a strikingly powerful narrative that is as profound as it is honest., Paynes interest is the human drama: hes very much the director-as-novelist and The Descendants has all the satisfactions of a story well told., As is the way with Paynes films, we go away feeling that every man is an island - and its only a matter of time before each of us finds ourselves deserted., The saving notes are the films minutiae. There are dialogue moments in Paynes drollest, enemies-on-edge style., Worth the wait. Dont stay away for so long next time though, Alex., This sweet, sad new film from Alexander Payne holds a promise of gentleness that is fulfilled, and a promise of complexity that isnt., Payne is an unobtrusive director, a filmmaker who lets the script do the walking - in this case, perhaps too much., A marvellous follow-up to 2004s Sideways - well worth the wait., Wants to be mature but cant help shortchanging its drama through constant reliance on its protagonists unimpeachable nobility., The challenge in describing the film is that it doesnt neatly fit into any pigeonhole. Its a serious movie that happens to have a sense of humor, because Payne and his collaborators see the absurdity in everyday existence., The Descendants is beautifully shot (by Phedon Papamichael) and compellingly performed, especially by its young stars, and it has moments of startling tenderness. If only it didnt feel phony to its bones., One of the years best films, a bubbly meditation on family and responsibility that weighs just enough to matter., In the hands of writer-director Alexander Payne, Clooney has rarely seemed so much at home., In playing an everyman stranded between anger and duty, Clooney earns an emotional payoff that a lesser actor would simply demand., With so many balls in the air the temptation is to rush from one plot strand to another, but Payne takes the opposite approach. He also captures the complexity of emotional reactions that grief stirs., Its Clooney and Woodleys movie, as they become a team before our eyes., The latest exhibit in Payne\s careful dissection of the beached male, which runs from Matthew Broderick\s character in Election to Jack Nicholson\s in About Schmidt and Paul Giamatti\s in Sideways."
Battle: Los Angeles,0,"Case in point: Battle: Los Angeles, an alien-invasion disaster piece so loud, ham-fisted and joyless-so aggressively lousy-that its only real usefulness is to make one better appreciate the deft touch of a Roland Emmerich., Terminally stupid., If the talk had been surgically removed, leaving only the sights and sounds of combat, this could have been a striking, semiabstract display of aggressive energy; as it is, any viewer over twelve will go for the laughs., One doesnt approach a movie like this expecting Shakespearean drama. Unlike some films with loftier ambitions, Battle Los Angeles pretty much delivers what it promises:, The film constantly blows thick smoke up our a---s and calls it charity., The special effects are mediocre and the story is strewn with the type of plot inconsistencies and lazy dialogue all-too-typical of todays post-content blockbusters., Watching this nonsense after seeing tragic television images of the destruction of Japan somehow made Battle: Los Angeles appear even more meretricious., It is a well executed one-violent-trick pony, designed for the 12 year old boy the movie studios hope is still playing with toy soldier figurines inside us all., Like the aliens themselves, the cliches were coming too fast. Unlike the aliens, they are indestructible., After a brief introduction to the cliched characters, the battle of the title is a violent, over-amplified affair..., Really need to watch District 9 again. Immediately., Feels less like a movie than the action scenes clipped out of one., With his hawklike profile and square jaw, the hyperstalwart Eckhart looks like a comic-book hero and acts like one, too. Hes so stalwart he creaks., Gosh darn it all if Battle: Los Angeles is hugely entertaining all on its own right thoughts about plagiarism or no., Battle Los Angeles is so derivative of superior films that youll spend half the running time merely making a list of movies that youd rather be watching., This film feels so much like a videogame your hands keep reaching for controllers -- shoot the aliens, shoot the aliens, shoot the aliens., Dont mean to boast, but I can suspend my disbelief as willingly as any credulous moviegoer. Yet not even an industrial crane would have helped here. Nope, Battle: Los Angeles completely defeated me., Pretty much cardboard, down to the heroic patriotic speeches, and less distinctive even than last years scarcely stellar Skyline, which trashed the same city., Its just running, shooting, dodging, killing, not badly done but pretty numbing over two hours., Neither as serious as Black Hawk Down nor as lightheartedly fun as Independence Day."
The Big Year,0,"The movie roams through its numerous picturesque locations with a pleasant enough grace, while Frankel adds just enough idiosyncratic musical and visual quirks to keep things interesting., Its theoretically possible for laughs to be gouged out of this scenario, but you wont find them here: every move, every joke, every emotion is heaved lumberingly into place., The Big Year is as glossy and inert as Martins face, which these days seems to require more foundation than the Burj Khalifa., In some alternate universe, a much better version of The Big Year exists, one that embraces the essential, insular weirdness and romantic fanaticism of the birding community it chronicles., The result is an offence-free, mild entertainment in which everyone from cast to scriptwriter seems to be winging it., Failing even to attempt genuinely humorous gags or scenarios, and incapable of conveying the thrill of its obsessive pastime or the majesty of the animals themselves, this feel-good male weepie remains comedically and dramatically grounded., Unfortunately, these comic geniuses are kept caged by the wan script and direction. The best gag in the film is the opening title card; the best joke, a throwaway by a day player., A very mild movie, but in the nicest sense of the word., What a waste that three of our finest actors are utilized as glorified bit players in such an instantly disposable comedy., The Big Year has charms: Not a jawdropping flock of them, but a number of sweet insights and warm laughs just the same., People watching birds is a nice thing. People watching a movie about people watching birds is sort of a snore., Its charms are as small as its singing feathered friends, but theyre real enough, and gentle enough, to lift it and give it flight., ...the film itself qualifies as a rara avis: a benign, good-hearted movie about three disparate characters search for happiness. The fact that its rated PG, and yet is intended for adult audiences, should tell you something about the movies nature., It\s nice to watch a comedy that doesn\t screech or foul the nest, but The Big Year is no big deal., The Big Year has heart and sweetness to spare - but as any birder will tell you, focus and energy count, too., This movie stubbornly refuses to take flight, or generate more than a few chuckles., A genial comedy with more power under its wings than it seems. This one could have flown over the cuckoos nest, or smacked into a glass pane, but instead lands in the middle of the road where quirky and popular meet., Bird-watching - or birding, as practitioners prefer to call it - makes for a stupefyingly boring movie., The scenery and the birds (at least the less obviously CGI birds) are lovely. But the personal lives of the three men are predictable and not very compelling., This gently charming comedy about a trio of birders is based on a winning premise, likable performances and stunning natural vistas."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2,0,"The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. Its also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest., For 10 years and eight films weve gotten to watch these young actors grow as people, as performers and as characters. It has been a true coming-of-age saga, in the fullest and most moving sense of the term., The grand finish, if not always inspired, feels necessary. In a sustained, imaginative way, this is the best of any movie series., The film is strong enough to have the unusual effect of improving its predecessors in the memory simply by association., Fiennes and Rickman get the actorly moments theyve been building toward for so long, and the film is most fun when it sticks to mechanics: roller coaster rides, battle scenes, close calls., One of the great things about this second Deathly Hallows is that it plays exceedingly well as either a stand-alone epic or a continuation of the previous chapter., For a grand finale to a truly epic, good-natured franchise, this is a perfect goodbye thats very hard to beat., Nothing can compare to the experience of reading J.K. Rowlings books, which have been expertly condensed and interpreted by screenwriter Steve Kloves, but given the need for compromise I think theyve done justice to the authors intentions (if not..., In the 10 years since Harrys first big- screen close-up, the spell has never been broken. And we Muggles have been made better for the magic., Its a pleasant irony that, just as the first installments of Rowlings oeuvre were better suited to page than screen, the final installments have reversed the relationship., Harry Potter, yeah, its not bad., When the movie was over, a young boy sitting behind me said, That was great! He was satisfied, and rightly so., Not that part two of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is bad, you understand; its much better than I expected, given the mediocrity of the series in general and the fizzle of part one in particular., Here at last, in the final chapter, the Harry Potter franchise rouses itself toward something approaching greatness … After eight installments, this last Harry Potter film finally left me wanting just a bit more., The finale is a great British triumph, twice as good as its predecessor, highly recommended. A happy ending, as I think its known., This is the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end., Its hard to imagine fans leaving the final Potter film with deep disappointment in this satisfying conclusion., Fasten your seat belts. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is an emotional roller-coaster ride., The best possible end for the series that began a decade ago., It is not often that we can chart a series over 10 years featuring the same child stars as they grow into adults. This phenomenon gives Deathly Hallows 2 a particular poignancy."
The Rite ,0,"What makes this film old is Anthony Hopkins and his laboured transformation into a tortured being, who needs to be tied up hand and foot, there to snarl and growl.Weve seen this Hopkins before, better done in his man-eating Hannibal Lecter role., , Parades about with a self-seriousness at odds with a second-half dominated by veiny-faced, limb-contorting special effects and screaming, screaming, screaming., This dreary affair is inspired by actual events, but its a very low-wattage entry into the genre of the exorcist movie., It may not convince you of the existence of the devil but, with its true-story twist on a popular cinematic theme, it adequately entertains., Its a fatuous film with none of the weight and dark energy of The Exorcist., Like many other bang-average exorcism movies, it follows a doubting man of God who rediscovers his faith, sharpish, when faced with a swivel-eyed grunter cracking their limbs and bellowing about Satan., The Devil may have all the best tunes, but this exorcism thriller wont count as one of his greatest gigs., The Vatican will love it. Audiences wont., Hopkins wild ham acting helps raise the deadening atmosphere and prick the mood of pomposity. What he cant do, sadly, is save his co-star., The acting is wooden from almost everyone, a Calvary of stick-figure performances, arms outstretched at moments of martyred or messianic climax., This is a dreary metaphysical drama dressed in the vestments of a religious horror movie., Hopkins does his thing, and Hallestrom leaves him alone to do it well., The direction by Håfström delivers sinister atmosphere but few shocks. Håfström forgets that God is in the details., The Rite trots out the tired old belief that catering to cynical viewers assumptions is half the battle in convincing them that theyre seeing something new, different, or possibly just worthwhile., Håfström allows Hopkins to fly completely off the handle, lets him channel his inner Hannibal Lecter in a way thats idiotic and silly., The Rite goes wrong in every way., , Starts glumly before flipping into supernatural camp., Despite an impressive cast (excluding the excruciatingly dull O\Donoghue, a newcomer from Ireland), The Rite is the sort of misfire that Hollywood has long buried in January."
Beastly ,0,"You go, Doog!, , Beauty And The Beast except with the lusty, gothic menace that makes that story interesting replaced by moany teenagers and crap acoustic guitar music. Or, in short, Dawsons Freak., In every aspect, from story to tone to characterization to visual aesthetic, its laughably perfunctory, as though everyone involved were too embarrassed to give it more than a half-ironic token effort., Beneath it all, however, is a movie with a good heart., This is Beauty and the Beast for the Twilight generation; theyve paid for abs and sparkles, and they insist on getting their moneys worth., Stunningly bad., Teens convinced that a pimple will kill their social life will find Beastly bracingly honest. Its the cynicism, not the phoned-in uplift, that works in this JV Grand Guignol., There are flashes of genuine wit and charm that, while they cannot support the rest, hint at what was intended and not realized., Resistance to this sort of commingling of the classical tale with the high school milieu is, as ever, totally futile, and to its credit, Beastly doesnt try so hard to fit within the framework of the fairy tale that it bends itself all out of shape., Beastly gets one timeless fact right: For hatchet faces, fatty cakes and Frankenskanks, high school can definitely feel like a curse., Meant to cash in on the craze for fantasy films about hormonal teens started by a certain chick-lit vampire series, Beastly merely shows how Twilight got it right., You have to admire the bravery of the filmmakers, who went ahead and made a movie despite not understanding the subject matter. Its also pretty impressive that anyone could miss the point of Beauty and the Beast., More than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances, high-glucose direction (Daniel Barnz), laughable dialogue, cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldnt pass muster on an after-school special., Oh, yes, the script is a little ham-fisted, plowing through exposition and establishing character with a steam shovel, but in a tale like this, sometimes being obvious and cutting to the chase can be a virtue., A tin-eared, corny attempt at fairy-tale interpretation., In an era of bullies and mean girls, Gossip Girls and Pretty Little Liars, it\s nice to have such a tenderhearted fairy tale., A pallid, formulaic teen romance that might have benefited from a little snark., Beastly is just as superficial and obsessed with looks as the characters and the mindset it rails against, which would seem like a bitter, frustrating irony if it merited the emotional reaction to care that much., Like Pettyfer, Vanessa Hudgens is blessed with amazing looks to go along with her limited acting."
Cowboys & Aliens,0,"From the cool special effects, to its top-notch acting and wickedly fun concept, Cowboys and Aliens is just that film that you may in fact hate to love. But it is really enjoyable., It must be said upfront that, for all its problems and script deficiencies, Cowboys & Aliens is probably the most continually entertaining effort of director Jon Favreaus still relatively young career., There is nothing that fascinating about Favreaus treatment, nor his source material, but compared with similar blockbuster fare of recent months, this curious exercise in genre bending is very watchable., If you can swallow the shameless set-up, its all highly entertaining., Jon Favreau handles the big setpieces with competence if no great flair; whenever the plot backs itself into a corner something else will make a sudden, inexplicable interruption., Favreau ... allows the materials imaginative possibilities to flare up and fade away., The density of inanity at the conceptual core of this crass sci-fi western starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford pushes outwards, inflating fatuous substance and propelling bric-a-brac in all directions., Yes, yes, cowboys punching aliens in the face can be funny. But it doesnt make this silly endeavour worthwhile., Craig is a bona fide action star who shouldn\t be reduced to spitting out lines like Demons took your gold in a husky Southern drawl., What started as True Grit-meets-War of the Worlds ends up closer to - whisper it - Wild Wild West., A simple entertainment in a summer of overcomplicated disappointments. Also much harder-edged than you may have expected., Takes itself much too seriously, with acts of brutality outnumbering the gags., As its title indicates, this is a strange cross of movie genres, and lest any viewers get antsy, it doesnt allow much time to pass before we first encounter UFOs in the Old West. The film takes its time unraveling the rest of the story..., Its fun to think about what Cowboys & Aliens might have been if any creativity had crept past the title page., Its a straight bland whiskey drink of a western, with a garnish of aliens on top., Cowboys & Aliens is an agreeable time-killer, but Ill bet a couple of clever kids could make a livelier movie with a Woody puppet and a Predator doll., A phenomenally successful two-man war against narrative clarity and continuity., Reminiscent of Starship Troopers. Just about everything in it is downright ridiculous, but its such an amusing and enjoyable fantastical adventure, who cares?, Director Jon Favreau earns his Western bona fides with a sharp eye for casting and locations. The first characters we see, after Daniel Craig, are a trio of authentic-looking cowboys played by Western veteran Buck Taylor and his two sons..., As bland as as plate of frontier beans."
X-Men: First Class,0,"The acting, special effects, and writing were excellent, except possibly the two times Xavier tries to hit on women in bars by saying they have groovy mutations., First Class can safely be watched by first-timers, but old faithfuls of the franchise will get a little more, tracing the origins of their favourite characters., If you didnt see the previous movies, you may not be able to appreciate some of the subtle references, but that wont make you enjoy the movie any less. Check it out., For reasons arising from the way the X-Men film franchise has developed, this is the first Marvel movie set in the period when the characters were created, and thus able to embrace the Rat Pack cool that was part of their original charm., In truth, the film is a very conventional summer potboiler repackaged in reasonably pretty, moderately crisp wrapping paper. In short, not quite groovy enough., In some glorious zone between Mad Men and Thunderbirds comes this X-Men prequel, as kinetic as it is character-driven, and full of ridiculous retro pleasures., All of this earlier part of the film, in which the young mutants discover each other and learn to control their powers, is engaging and amusing, smartly filmed and scripted. The second half, however, outstays its welcome., Why be so harsh and long-winded about a superhero movie? Because its an ambitious superhero movie., The climax is the biggest letdown, a giant hash of crosscutting and unremarkable (in an era in which weve seen everything) CGI., As X-Men films go, this one gets the job done and is certainly better than Last Stand or Wolverine. But there are still just too darn many X-Men., Looks and feels like a very cheesy Cold War-era B movie..., Easily chimes in as the best, most engaging and visually impressive X-film so far., Its all vastly superior to Brett Ratners scorched-earth X-Men: The Last Stand, of course. But new blood and swinging Sixties milieu aside, X-Men: First Class never finds a fresh way to sell the same message weve been hearing since the first X-Men., The great strength of the X-Men series is the way it taps into the feelings of all teenagers of being mutants. It is a natural part of that time of life to feel alienated and isolated, a bit horrified with the changes they are going through., Serviceable but seems more dutiful than dynamic, and is muddled by all sorts of random false notes., Surprise, surprise, but X-Men: First Class is the first sequel (or in this case prequel) of the summer that actually, doesnt just meet expectations, but surpasses them., It uses the themes of the previous movies to build an intelligent, fast-paced, and highly entertaining prequel., This blazing pre-boot breathes new life into the sagging franchise, The film is ultimately undone by that old paradox of Hollywood movie production: If you are given enormous budget, you have to spend every penny., New decade; same ol same ol."
In Time,0,"The films central metaphor is so sublimely obvious it feels like its been stolen from a forgotten Star Trek script., If youre just after popcorn thrills, then In Time is not a complete waste of time, but future generations will not remember it., In Time is so crammed with provocative ideas it begins to feel over-crowded., The movie meanders in circles, frustratingly wasting its intriguing premise showcasing a story of Robin Hood meets Bonnie and Clyde-like heroic villains on the run thats as rudimentary as it is forgettable., Clever and unsettling., Timberlake is fine but not as good as he was in The Social Network because he doesnt get the chances. Its a pity, but this sort of thing needs a brighter director., A playful caper that ticks along on the strength of its cast., Its all just big-budget dress-up in a futurescape that reeks of phoniness., Attempts to be both thriller and political allegory but ultimately falls someway short of being either., If times so valuable, why does Seyfried run everywhere in six-inch heels?, Niccols major problem is timing: action sequences and dialogue scenes lie flat on the screen, while his tendency to play around with pacing means that any tension quickly dissipates. Lifes too short., Interesting ideas and howling anger at the 1 percent drive the first half, but the Bonnie and Clyde stylings of the second feel a little rushed and strangely out of sync., The film is beautifully shot in chilly blues and grays by cinematographer Roger Deakins, and Los Angeles locales are well chosen for futuristic effect. Most of the time, however, I found myself glancing at the clock on my own wrist., Niccols zippy direction, joined to a sleek, rich production design, keeps the movie spinning like a shiny toy., A movie so consistently flat-footed, with pauses between lines of dialogue so vast, that you begin to wonder if the whole thing might be a psychological experiment of some kind., Nothing more than a clumsily executed preach-a-thon., Happily, there are some laughs en route. More happily yet, a few of them are even intentional., In Time is filled with sly references and obvious puns, as well as sometimes heavy-handed parallels to class warfare., Its a little like Michael Bays The Island in the way the narrative fails to live up to the promise of its back story., Niccol, whose excellent 1997 film Gattaca revealed a similar obsession with human genetics, is an above-average filmmaker who may simply lack the daredevil recklessness a project like this requires."
Smashed ,0,"Smashed tells a familiar story with subtle simplicity, never beating the audience over the head with its themes or ideas., While writer/director James Ponsoldts screenplay tends to saunter along at times as it seeps further into starkness, Winstead and Pauls performances will keep you engaged until the end., A film thats good on general atmosphere, totally sincere and not too sentimental., Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the essential cog in James Ponsoldts insightful drama., Winstead gives a very good performance: muddled, scared, but courageous., Wheedling and hectoring by turn, ham-dram to the hilt, full of small ideas and Big Acting, the film trails talentlessly in the wake of Days of Wine and Roses., Largely meeting its modest goals, its a nuanced take on patterns of dependency, and the best chance yet for this feisty young actress to prove her mettle., The sharp ends in Smashed are here for all to see, and Ponsoldt never shies away from their spiky, thought-provoking effect. Yet he also finds grace and warmth in the story., There will never be another Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor, but Hollywood may have found a new Lee Remick in Mary Elizabeth Winstead., Winstead and Paul make their characters feel like flesh and blood, not stereotypical Lost Weekenders. Their love is as real as their future is shaky. And thats the films great tragedy., Smashed may be better at preaching to the choir and is likely to find its largest audience among struggling 12-steppers., The camera work is handheld and jittery, reflecting Kates often wobbly state of mind, and the characters decidedly nonglam wardrobe, minimal makeup and charm-free home feel honest and right., Winstead, a relative newcomer, handily carries this slender film., Its an addiction-and-recovery movie without the usual side-effect of wallowing melodrama., Winstead is an inarguably warm actor. Shes just not doing the sort of work that transcends the movies shortcomings., Smashed belongs to Winstead., As disappointingly predictable as the final chapters are, nothing can diminish Winsteads outstanding performance as Kate., Winstead is terrific as a young woman scared into sobriety, only to discover telling people the truth is much harder than lying and hiding her addiction., Smashed never really rises much above the level of a dramatic public service announcement., The act of going out there as an unknown and coming back a star is the time-honored showbiz fantasy, and if there\s any justice that\s about to come true for Mary Elizabeth Winstead on the basis of Smashed."
Lincoln ,0,"Lincoln is a triumph., Its narrative swoop largely takes the legislative detail in its stride, plus the star is Daniel Day-Lewis, which is always a thing. He is not so much an actor, more a shape shifter., Its an intricate, thought- provoking and (be warned) very talkie study of democracy that is almost entirely schmaltz-free., Lincoln is an engrossing and even stirring civics lesson that tries, with admirable responsibility if only mixed success, to give voice to black America., Its very good, but thats not the point. Its necessary., Against the odds, Spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling., Spielberg is a man on a mission. And his not so secret weapon is Day-Lewis, an actor so charismatic its hard to think clearly while hes on screen., By stepping into history without fear, favour or any overfamiliar biopic folly, Lincoln, handsome, often thrilling, and movingly human, goes into history as a major movie achievement., A rousing, rigorous and morally complex legal procedural more than a trad biopic. And all the better for it., What a feat from Day-Lewis: the nearest thing a 21st-century biopic can get to a seance., Its tiresome to describe Day-Lewis as brilliant, so lets push the boat out: his Lincoln is absolutely wonderful., Lincoln works as a snapshot of a great man without ever slipping into a portrait of sainthood., As unexpected as it is intelligent, thanks to virtuoso work from Spielberg and Kushner, Lincoln is landmark filmmaking, while Day-Lewis is so authentic he pulls off that stovepipe., This is movie magic -- history coming to life, before our eyes., Its the most remarkable movie Steven Spielberg has made in quite a spell, and one of the things that makes it remarkable is how it fulfills those expectations by simultaneously ignoring and transcending them., Lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon. We dont need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was - this window is more than sufficient., Lincoln offers proof of what magic can happen when an actor falls in love with his character. Because as great as Day-Lewis has been in his many parts, he has never seemed quite so smitten., Day-Lewis convincingly comprehends Lincolns melancholy and his humor; his self-deprecation and brandishing of authority; his backwoods simplicity and his highly literate verbal dexterity…, Master shape-shifter Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a monumental portrayal of a man so firmly monumented in our nations history., The film masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life: how to bring the war between the states to an end, and how to eradicate slavery, once and for all."
Lola Versus,0,"LOLA VERSUS puts the fun in dysfunctional love and is what happens when you shake life up a little bit and let it fall out of your hands., An hour and a half of wearisome quirk and smut..., Gerwigs dreamy style worked in Whit Stillmans Damsels in Distress, because the movie created an eco-system of oddity in which that style could thrive. But here it just grates., Gerwigs done enough good work to allow us to chalk this one up as a glossy blip., Versus what, precisely? Or is it whom?, Its such a mopey, navel-gazing affair that even Gerwig has a hard time saving it., An extremely smart, exquisitely funny film about finding yourself amid the clang and clutter of contemporary life., While Lola is adorable throughout, neither she nor the film will be remembered the morning after., Lola Versus is all Greta all the time, a bonanza for fans and proof that Gerwigs easy offbeat charm, obvious smarts and physical comedy gifts can carry a film., There\s a Fitzgeraldian sense of generational malaise in all of this, but Lola Versus is convinced that it\s hilarious., Its a wonder Gerwig manages to keep the character endearing instead of grating, but she does., Gerwig remains one of the most captivating new stars to hit the big screen, but shes still looking for a movie that deserves her., Screenwriters Daryl Wein (who also directed) and Zoe Lister Jones give Gerwig very little to do other than to be Gerwig., Its funny, sweet, wise and even a little life-affirming., Too self-conscious, too slight, too few insights., The self-pitying Lola, alas, is only sporadically interesting..., An unfinished portrait of an unfinished womanchild with fidgety poise nicely embodied by Gerwig., A well-intentioned indie that tries to be a real version of a Hollywood romantic comedy and ends up feeling more ersatz than ever., Unfortunately, Lola lives in a sitcom that deprives her of any intrinsic interest., Lola Versus feels more like a slog through the breakup doldrums than the frothy, intimate growing-up story it hints at throughout."
The Paperboy ,0,"Fetid, scuzzy, revolting, funny, erotic, perplexing and provocative, its like the bastard child of Cape Fear, Written On The Wind and Killer Joe., If you like that freaky, perverted feeling of spying on an even bigger freak show, you will find this film both fascinating and horrible to watch., Daniels turns out to be the ideal director for a film about the tendency of desire to turn sane minds to guacamole., Daniels cant find his directorial bearings., The Paperboy is not all bad, but it isnt all good either. Im not quite sure what Daniels wanted his audience to walk away with., Ill just get it out of the way now: The Paperboy is unbelievably awful., The Paperboy is flawed, more deserving of a rubbernecking than a viewing. But its hard to tear your eyes away., It may yet become a camp classic, if no other kind., With Precious and The Paperboy, Daniels has confirmed his status as the most emotionally incontinent director of his generation., So bad it isnt even good-bad., A sleazy, overstuffed and terribly directed mess. But never boring and occasionally jaw-dropping., Watch it with Killer Joe for the ultimate sweaty, twisted double-bill., Despite all its garish accoutrements and salacious underpinnings, The Paperboy can be a hoot to watch., The Paperboy is one of those rare examples where you might wish the movie was less faithful to the book., Yes, its a dizzying stew set to boil., The Paperboy is southern Gothic wallowing in the swamp of low camp. And if the wallowing were deliberate, this might have been hugely funny., The Paperboy bears some promise as a good-bad movie, but it unfolds as a bad-bad one., Its a movie that seems to have a mild form of heatstroke: its blurry, as if filmed long ago, and feverish, and the story wanders all over the place as if lost in a bayou. When its over, you want to wipe your brow., The Paperboy is over-the-top every which way you look., This one has it all: sex, violence, torture, incest, jellyfish attacks, telekinetic masturbation, Nicole Kidman peeing on Zac Efron and a gator gutted in revolting close-up."
Lawless ,0,"Lawless wants to be something larger than life, but its too joyless to be a tall tale and too self-satisfied for tragedy., Hillcoat makes a foray into Virginias Prohibition-era moonshine country. But the adaptation (by Hillcoat compadre Nick Cave) is a hokey piece of pop history that wearyingly insists upon its own mythos like a comic-book blockbuster., Its slight and casual to the point of laziness, but its straight fun, done with knowledge and a laconic pleasure. You could do far worse., Lawless is a compellingly nutty and uneven gangster film., Certainly has its moments, yet lacks the tension of a real classic., Whereas, for the most part, the film comes across as a competent muddle, it actually becomes full on disastrous when Pearce is on screen., It is thoroughly corrupt in its lip-smacking love of violence and has a script, written by Nick Cave, so transparent it verges on the comic., You may be laughing out loud at the very moment youre also feeling appalled., The center of narrative gravity is hard to locate; for whom are we rooting, and does anything really ripple outward from this nasty local fight?, An uneven mix of impressively executed, violent clichs about good ol boys defending the American right to flout the law., Fans of The Proposition will have to settle for sublimely evil performances by Gary Oldman (as a murderous rival) and Guy Pearce (as a government agent) and a large quotient of gut-wrenching violence., Pearce, in gloves and slicked-down hair parted in the middle, is one of the best villains of the year., Although it slides down easily, theres very little kick to this moonshining picture., With a dynamite cast, an iconic screenwriter in rocker Nick Cave and an Aussie director in John Hillcoat, you assume a new classic. What you get is an ambitious try., You can sense the filth, and smell the rust, and feel the ingrained poverty that might well convince a family of survivors (of World War I and the Spanish flu) to make their fortune selling moonshine to their neighbors., Theres something at the movies heart that remains flimsy and inauthentic, a kid in his older brothers ill-fitting shoes., Much of the action may be nearly as grim as in director John Hillcoat\s previous feature, The Road - Lawless is very bloody - but the scenery and production design are a whole lot nicer., This isnt to say that theres not enough here, but just dont look for it all to add up., Lawless is filled with forbidding shadows and verdant abundance, contrasting the indifference of nature with the violence of the humanity within it., I can only admire this films craftsmanship and acting, and regret its failure to rise above them."
Dark Shadows ,0,"Sad to report, the Tim Burton opus is an unnecessarily complicated tale involving too many characters, not to mention an unresolved moral conundrum that has us happily rooting for an unapologetic mass serial killer., The only reason to see Dark Shadows is to discover how dire and pointless-how flat-out dreadful-a movie can be even when it has Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Helena Bonham Carter attached to its flimsy pretext., Certainly delivers the goods on several levels without quite rising to the heights to which it aspires., After watching the film, an odd, somewhat disjointed comedic drama about family and sacrifice set to Burtons own uniquely macabre cinematic beat, Im not quite sure what to call this new take on the venerable property., This is not so much a coherent movie as it is a long, expensive joke in search of a purpose., You may not care much for what happens to the characters, but there sure is a lot to ogle while they go about their nonsensical business., Mostly Dark Shadows is silly when were trained to expect slightly richer fun from Burton and Depp., Fans of Depps past collusions with Burton will find their rewards along the way. But theres a perfunctory vibe to the goings on, a weariness amid the weirdness., Feels less like a fond and knowing tribute than a work of indifferent, uninspired hackery., Rarely has a film more aptly proven the more is less theory - part comedy, part horror, part \70s spoof, part soap opera. And yet none of the genres in this mash-up are the least bit successful., Dark Shadows is an amusing piece of high camp, stoked by Depps deadpan star performance and the kind of elaborate trappings one would expect from Burton., Dark Shadows has to be the most perfunctory, most self- parodic entry to the Burton canon thus far., It is at any rate better value than the disappointing Alice in Wonderland., Dark Shadows only meaningful relationship is between Depp and his audience. Hes a persona now, no longer an actor., How bad is Dark Shadows? It makes you long for a Twilight movie. That\s bad., Dark Shadows\\ certainly has its moments, especially when Barnabas and Angelique hilariously wreck her office during a surreal, CGI-fueled, PG-rated tryst., At once a brash, strutting pop culture pastiche and gloomy exercise in self-cannibalizing nostalgia, Dark Shadows is depressing on myriad levels., Cant decide whether its a parody, a horror comedy, an atmospheric melodrama, or a tedious bucket of crap. Eventually it chooses the last one., Wonderfully weird visuals from Tim Burton and a highly watchable performance by his muse, Johnny Depp cannot keep the tone from faltering and the results are unsatisfying., When you consider all the pitfalls avoided, and all the laughs and pleasures it provides along the way, Dark Shadows is a satisfying and skillful effort."
The Man with the Iron Fists,0,"One is occasionally infuriated by the archness of the exercise. But there is a charming innocence to Fists faith in the values of 1970s cross-cultural exploitation., Predictably, this kind of gleeful fanboy excess yields diminishing returns. RZA hasnt much sense of storytelling rhythm, and lacks Tarantinos gift for turning adolescent obsessions into something uniquely personal., Thank goodness for Russell Crowe who gives a sardonic, who-gives-a-damn performance as one of the good guys., Self-defeatingly Tarantino-esque., Its leaden, boorish and dull., an affectionate recreation of Shaw Brothers kung fu, but for all its inventive weaponry & varied fighting methods, its heady mle of sex & gore, its grand gestures and nostalgic stylings, it is also entirely lacking in any real substance of its own., Numb pastiche, so frazzled you cant find a pulse., The grindhouse grinds on. There are a few pretty sparks among the ugly noises., Wu-Tangs RZA makes an assured directorial debut with this gloriously violent grindhouse martial arts fantasy., Let the brilliant, epic silliness of The Man With the Iron Fists engulf you in a tsunami of crimson cheese and you, like I, will have a super-happy-fun-big-smile-crazy-face-monkey-time., Lunatic, slipshod, absurdly violent, horribly acted, and borderline incomprehensible., Theres little happening here except slavish imitation and embarrassing hackwork., If Iron Fists is sometimes badly made, it is refreshingly badly made., No matter the medium, RZA is a world-builder who has conceptualized the contours of the rich, bloody, dense universe he created down to the most insignificant details., The blood spurts, the knives shoot out, and the fists fly - but The Man with the Iron Fists never takes off., The Man With the Iron Fists is the type of movie that feels like you are always coming in half-way through, even if you watch it from the beginning. As an exercise in genre, this is the highest compliment., An homage to old-school kung fu movies that ends up being more fun in theory than it is on the screen, The Man With the Iron Fists boasts some giddy, bloody action sequences and a whole lot of dull genre cliches the rest of the time., At 96 minutes it is exactly 93 1/2 minutes too long., Clarity is essential in a film of this type, and as often as not (RZA) gives us chaos;, It may just be one of the best bad movies ever."
Mirror Mirror ,0,"Mirror, Mirror wont change your life, but its a fun homage to a timeless classic that lets you escape into a fairy tale world, that actually doesnt seem to far away from here., Tarsem directs as confidently as ever, and while the movie isnt quite the magical ride it potentially could have been to say I left the theatre feeling fairly happily ever after wouldnt be too far off the mark., Youll laugh intermittently, but more often, youll notice where youre supposed to be laughing and arent., This umpteenth reiteration of the fairy tale has held fast to its most tiresome aspects: Snow Whites dull sweetness and the evil Queens one-track motivation., Mirror Mirror is as gaudily spectacular as you expect if youve seen director Tarsem Singhs films, The Fall and Immortals., The film sleepwalks along confidently enough in its numb, semi-unfunny, semi-unserious way. But the tales passion and subversion have been removed., Superlative performances from Roberts and Hammer almost cover the shortcomings. Like most Tarsem films its a muddle, but this time not one with enough distracting dazzle., A colourful and sophisticated spin on a well-known tale, recommended for children of all ages., Mirror, Mirror is a trippy version of the Snow White story., Mirror Mirror is a film thats all picture and no propulsion, each scene static in a basic set-decoration color scheme of teabag and banana., A lithe, literate, extravagantly daffy redesign of Snow White., The only ones who get the comedy are Nathan Lane and the dwarves., The actors are all at sea, especially the miscast Roberts, whose arch manner never suggests even a pantomime version of evil. Conversely, Lily Collins makes an overly knowing Snow White, smirking demurely as if shed just stepped off the Gossip Girl set., Here, the familiar tale is retold with concessions to feminist self-determination and camp humor, bending the Grimm Brothers tale without infringing on its basic beauty., Singh is much more skilled as a visual artist than a storyteller, and his artistic fortunes seem to rise and fall with the inspiration of his screenwriters. In this case hes lucked out., Whats the last movie you saw that created an imaginary world bursting with color and beauty and inspiration? A world that reminded you of the feeling you had as a child the first time you saw Dorothy open that door on the Technicolor world of Oz?, Who wants to see a fairy tale that weighs a ton? Mirror Mirror reflects badly on everyone involved., Mirror Mirror is an odd little fantasia of a movie -- part jaunty adventure, part broad romantic comedy, part auteurist spectacle., This rambling version of Snow Whites tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance., This is a film in which bee-stung lips are achieved with real bees stings and puppy love can make a man behave like an actual puppy. Truly, its the stuff of fairy tales."
Smiley ,0,"The storytelling gets repetitive, but there is enough here to make Smiley feel fresh and more or less satisfying as a low-key creeper., This remainder-bin horror movie is impossible to take seriously., Internet chat rooms provide the dubious hook for this generic slasher movie., A modest, low-budget horror movie with some effective ideas and an engaging lead performance but it clutters itself down with too much dialogue about its title character and the very concept of evil being potentially brought to physical life., This film will not do for the Internet what Psycho did for showers-no more computers have to be smashed because of it., A by-the-numbers slasher pic., Smileys face, or lack of one, is the single creepy effect in the limited trick bag of first-time writer-director Michael Gallagher, age 24, who otherwise relies, again and again, on false-scare musical shrieks to make audiences jump."
The Way Way Back,0,"Sundance would not be Sundance without a few unbelievably stupid, clichéd, graceless movies in the mix., The film has been complacently concocted for likability even as it gives you very little thats real, structured, or spontaneous enough to enjoy., If you\re first act was writing the Oscar winning screenplay for The Descendants, looking for an encore can be tough. But Nat Faxon and Jim Rash leveraged that win and made the leap to directing their own small-budget, bighearted coming of age comedy., Nice comedic work from Sam Rockwell and Allison Janney buoys this pleasant but routine coming-of-age drama by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash., Never mind the text; feel the texture., For all the longueurs, there are still enough moments of near brilliance to sustain you through the trip., Warm, funny - and even fresh., A coming-of-age tale by numbers that dont all add up., This films masterstroke is showing everything from Duncans point of view, without the traditional cloying narration., A film for every age, whether youre an awkward kid, former awkward kid or awkward kid-adjacent. Funny, real and uplifting. A film that reaffirms your belief in the human spirit., Like many of the best films in this genre The Way, Way Back is rooted in truth: honest observations about family dynamics, adolescence, dependence and independence., An unexpected yet irresistible cross between Meatballs and The Ice Storm, The Way Way Back just may be the best movie of the summer., The coming-of-age tale The Way, Way Back is sweet, heartfelt and utterly trite and predictable from beginning to end., Aiming for a middle path between drama and comedy, The Way Way Back is so overloaded with jokes that it could sink in the water hazard, but on the final scorecard, sure enough, it\s in the hole., Nostalgia often tinges our memories in soft, warm colors; something like The Way Way Back reminds us of the good, the bad, and the cringe-worthy., Once again, the oppressed American teen-ager lopes and shuffles to center stage, there to display his woes., The sometimes airy, sometimes claustrophobic ambiance fills you with the same bittersweet feeling as spinning a half-forgotten Golden Oldie at a backyard cookout., The films primary pleasure is watching James communicate Duncans growing confidence in the acceleration of his stride or the occasional unguarded smile. Its a likable acting turn, though one the film does not always serve honestly., Waterslides and infidelity just dont go together., Any movie that lifts from both This Boy\s Life and Meatballs is a rarefied creation, and in this case a pretty wonderful movie."
Oblivion ,0,"Its a shame that its poor editing inhibits what could have been a memorable movie., Heres the trouble with mainstream science fiction filmmaking these days: theres no expectation that an audience is capable of putting things together or waiting for a payoff., The story that eventually surfaces is no where near as interesting as the mesmerizing look of the film., Although it looks spectacular and boasts some pungent ideas, the surprise-to-running-time ratio is out of whack., As a piece of narrative, though, its portentous, sluggish and fatally ungripping., It takes more than an hour for Oblivion to become whatever it is the filmmakers think its supposed to be., In space, Jack hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn., Large-scale, original sci-fi is a hard thing to come by these days, and despite its familiar story Oblivion does dream up some great ideas, Feels ever more grounded and stuck ..., Ultimately, Oblivion is aptly named - no other movie so far this year has been so instantly forgettable., Was Cruise trying to beat out fellow Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi epic ever?, If nothing else, Oblivion will go down in film history as the movie where Tom Cruise pilots a white, sperm-shaped craft into a giant space uterus., This is the sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band., Glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered., The story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes but, as with so many other Cruise productions, the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice., The sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me - and many other people, I suspect - to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski., Oblivion is an okay blockbuster, a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence., Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end). Yes, a great deal is derivative, but its fast-moving derivative., Absent of any sense of self-awareness, Oblivion seems only self-serious, a ponderous mess both misguided and unaware., More adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, Oblivion makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn\t let you go."
The Wolverine ,0,"A multimillion dollar pile of tedium., Most of all, I love being able to say finally that Hugh Jackman killed as The Wolverine., Japan seems valued more for its scenery and costumes than anything having to do with its character., The action is swift, Jackman is jacked, and the 3D looks great. Where the film falters is the final act, which turns into a silly cartoon., Its a relief to come across a blockbuster that finds a location and stays there, rather than hopping desperately from one place to the next ..., A gingery palate cleanser in a summer of overcooked Big Macs., Getting Wolverine to the movies above-average finale required three writers - Christopher McQuarrie, Mark Bomback, and Scott Frank - to pad the plot., ...this serious script suddenly reaches for cheesy catchphrase dialogue toward the end, in what seems to be an act of desperation., It restores the tarnished lustre to this most fan-beloved of Marvel characters by doing precisely what Chris Claremont and Frank Millers near-sacred 1982 run did: It pumps some feeling into the guy along with his muscles and steel talons., Director James Mangolds film features some breathtakingly suspenseful action sequences, exquisite production and costume design and colorful characters, some of whom register more powerfully than others., Too quickly the random fights pile up -- so many yakuza thugs who forgot to wear chain mail that morning -- and you yearn for the film that might have been., Mangold front-loads the action, but near the end theres a first-rate fight atop a bullet train between Wolverine/Logan and some especially pesky ninjas. It puts the train fights in the recent The Lone Ranger to shame., Weve seen better. Weve seen worse. Have another few yards ready for me in a years time., Just as comic-book movie fatigue was starting to set in, along comes The Wolverine to revive a moribund summer of superheroes., The idea of Wolverine fighting off waves of yakuza and ninjas amid shoji screens is tantalizing, but Mangold bungles the staging and cuts so fast that you cant ever savor their silhouettes., Whether in the fights or the love scenes, we dont know where to invest our emotional energy., Its a credit to the production team that these elements somehow work, with the movie at its best as a superhero/Asian crime drama mash-up., Although The Wolverine eventually falls back on a comic-book formula and CG effects (the climactic face-off between Logan and a giant silver warriorlike thing is totally generic), Mangold and his team find time to explore more nuanced realms ..., This is a serious, sometimes dark and deliberately paced story., A handful of bold ideas brought down by the need to regress to a blander, more box-office-friendly middle ground."
Admission ,0,"Portia is in many ways a typical Tina Fey character but the unfunny and clichéd script too often reminds us this is no 30 Rock., It is neither a broad comedy nor a dopey rom-com; its actually, surprisingly enough, a seriocomic drama in something resembling the Alexander Payne mold, a slightly eccentric examination of flawed people doing their very best., At the heart of the problem with this movie are matters of logic and cogency., Have you ever wondered how the admission procedure functions in Ivy League universities? No, me neither., Intermittently sharp but often dully over-extended., The comic material really isnt there, and the plot transitions feel forced and uncomfortable ..., The movie subverts expectations, and not in a good way, by seeming in a dither about its own identity., This is comedy with zero pulse., The themes are important, even if in this Hollywood laundering they are sloshed about in love suds and clattered by uneven comedy spins., Occasionally charming but mostly bland fare from Weitz, despite the reliable cast. About A Boy remains the best showcase of his talents., The many strands of this amiable yet overstuffed romantic comedy dont hang together, though each, on its own, has a modest charm., What is most distressing about Admission is that it serves as further evidence that Tina Fey, despite her dominance of the small screen, has not yet mastered the big one., This is certainly an interesting idea, though the movie is badly handicapped by Fey, who must venture beyond her usual snippiness into scenes of genuine poignancy and proves unequal to the task., Granted, this is not automatic laugh-riot material, nor should it be, but didnt Fey recognize how hackneyed it all is?, If Fey ends up making movies as good as this one over the next few years, televisions loss will have been cinemas gain, for real., This would be a good movie for a parent to watch with a high-school-age child facing down the college admissions slog-its mildly snarky but resolutely uncynical., Some films are electric - Admission settles for alternating current., When in doubt, maam, just ask yourself: What would Tina Fey do?, In their central roles, Rudd and Fey have a natural, unforced chemistry. John and Portia are cute as buttons, but theyre also goofy, confused and flawed people., The commercials make it look like a standard romantic comedy but the plot line about reuniting with a child put up for adoption feels awkward, cluttered, and intrusive."
The Croods,0,"The Croods isnt particularly smart, but it has just enough wit to keep us engaged and just enough speed to keep us from feeling restless., It captures the wonder (and more gently, the anxiety) of discovery time and time again. And the filmmakers have a hoot playing with the Croods encounters with, as well as their misunderstandings of, all things new., As family viewing, its pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way thats boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys., The animation is first-rate, with moments of genuine visual imagination, and the story, while unremarkable, is entirely adequate., How to Train Your Dragon and Lilo & Stitch are completely indicative of the experience you\ll have with The Croods, which is to say a supremely positive one., It may not be an instant animated classic, but its a charmer that will leave the kids ... feeling warm and fuzzy ..., The family-dramedy genre that the film inhabits demands a bit more narrative ingenuity than is on display., Bold visually but thumpingly ordinary storytelling., DreamWorks has done much better, and Pixar appears to be in a different league altogether., Fast-paced, inventive animated comic adventure of a Stone Age family gets an extra boost from the lively vocal performances of stars Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds., While their situation sounds dire, The Croods is not. The DreamWorks animated film has enough slapstick humor, furry sidekicks and zippy 3-D action sequences to keep the story light., Even the lively visuals and unrelenting thrill-ride pace cant disguise rough-hewn storytelling, or the fact that the tale of a old-fashioned macho cave dad and his family seems a bit yabba-dabba done that already., This movie not only has its heart in the right place, it has its brain in the right place., Id like to take back all those times I said Nicolas Cage was one of the most annoying actors on film. It turns out hes equally terrible when hes only on the soundtrack., The Croods is light fare, but it explores a serious theme, if only superficially., The latest advances in computer animation have been applied to a truly primitive comedy-Ice Age recast with a family of nattering Neanderthals., Co-directed by Chris Sanders, brains behind the excellent How to Train Your Dragon , the latest flick from DreamWorks turns out to be moving, funny and highly original., Like the continents, its a little too easy to drift away., It might even give the little ones something more challenging to think about than its tired main plot., A sort of methadone for die-hard Ice Age fans."
We're the Millers,0,"The movies lingering close-ups on yearning faces and heart-to-heart conversations force the fake Millers into real familial longing thats more bogus than the family itself., Naturally, there are roadblocks galore -- but the breezy film stays one mile ahead in terms of plot and punch lines, The central conceit is well established, the comedy is often impressively sour and the four leads complement one another beautifully., Its a goofy road movie with some nice gags., This is a fine collection of cheap and sleazy jokes, well-told ..., With jokes cloned from bad taste movies and off-kids-telly villains, it doesnt even qualify for dumb fun., A likeable comedy that uses its greatest asset, its talented, funny cast, to good effect., Stays mean and maintains a bit of an edge even when it threatens to go all soft and gooey., The baseline for American movie humor sinks once again in this sentimentally cynical and cynically sentimental farce., It boils down to the idea that men and women alike yearn for what they dont have, and that making your way through life is about seizing the bizarre opportunities it thrusts at you., Though incredibly predictable from start to finish, We\re the Millers did make me laugh., Were the Millers clicks on just enough cylinders to warrant a recommendation., While its plot points are pedestrian at best, the genius -- at least, the definite charm -- of Were the Millers is its notion of family as something beyond a simple blood connection, particularly when exigent circumstances create the ties that bind., As a comedy couple, Aniston and Sudeikis arent exactly Cheech and Chong, but their well-matched timing and clashing attitudes often create comic sparks that erupt into laughter., a movie written by a committee, too long, but the cast carries it a long way, these mild virtues dont quite add up to a recommendation, but if you said you wanted to see it I wouldnt block the door., Some of the jokes are funny. If one was to compile all the good snippets and scenes into a highlight reel, it might run about six minutes., Though the cast partially eschews the family-friendly timidity that the film defers to in the end, this would-be wild thing remains little more than a rowdy endorsement of the status quo., The plot isnt particularly sound and some jokes fall flat, but the appeal of watching this family come together is so enjoyable and satisfying, it makes the film a worthy watch., The filmmakers lack the courage of their convictions, falling back on moments of egregiously false sentimentality whenever the material threatens to turn dark., The result is a loose conglomeration of jokes that never really holds together: Funny in parts, but overwhelmed by the bland emptiness where its protagonist should be."
The Best Man Holiday,0,"The result is a joyous, raucous, righteous film but also a frustrating and disappointing one. Not quite the gift of the season some had hoped for., Yet for all its tonal missteps and traditional tropes, The Best Man Holiday has something rare at its very center - genuine emotion., Touching, fun, unexpected yet a bit disjointed, The Best Man Holiday will satisfy die-hard fans of the first film and help usher in the holiday movie season., Earnest performances by Morris Chestnut and Monica Calhoun anchor the film., The first half is such an agreeably raucous reunion that we hate to see a pesky thing like terminal illness ruin all the fun., You leave emotionally exhausted, but theres a lot of care in this movie., While the script may be uneven and the film itself overlong, the cast make for winning company, turning a deft hand to material that zigzags between bawdy and mawkish, somehow keeping it on just the right side of sympathetic., The Best Man Holiday pigs out on every plot at a slow, bloated Christmas pace. Watch out, movie punters. Were segueing into Part Three., The sweet n sour mood turns purely gloopy in the last act, which involves a certain football game and the intervention of an earth-bound angel., Like many awkward, clanger-filled real-life Christmas gatherings, it goes through some alarmingly rocky patches, but comes together in the end., Its a genially soapy time-killer, though Lees as shameless in invoking cancer as he is about the catfights and smacktalk., Several schmaltzy and contrived sub-dramas clamour for attention. None warrant a Kleenex despite the best efforts of a mostly fine ensemble cast who fare much better with gags and camaraderie in the early goings., The Best Man Holiday is an inelegant movie, but its cast is so damn likable that were still willing to follow them - even when theyre not going anywhere., A movie that does to your emotions exactly what one player does to another on the big Christmas game day: slams them to the ground and stomps them silly., Its no mean feat, stitching together comic bonhomie and Kleenex-wadding melodrama, but Lee makes it look easy. And even, yes, a little sexy. Take that, middle age., Even if some of the crudeness and the drama feel forced, its hard to hate., The Best Man Holiday gives holidays a bad name., The Best Man Holiday has the potential to become a staple of Christmastime movie watching in the \hood., The mix of raunchy sex comedy and Christian faith doesnt quite come off., Though not so warm and fuzzy as some fans may expect, The Best Man Holiday is a more than fitting return that improves upon the original in unexpected ways."
Boyhood ,0,"...it’s hyperbolic in its minimalism and boring in spots and its overall narrative reach often exceeds its grasp. Even still, it’s one of the most important movies of the decade so far and you should experience it just to say you did., Like Michael Apted in his Seven Up! documentary series, Linklater makes you feel as if youre watching a photograph as it develops in the darkroom., An audacious effort from a filmmaker whose ability to embed the audience in his stories is unmatched., Calling it a sum of its parts can be a backhanded compliment, but it feels like especially worthy praise for Boyhood, considering how much went into making it feel whole., Boyhood reveals itself as something deeper, more noteworthy and ambitious than even its remarkable production would suggest, for Linklater has given us nothing less than a cinematic approximation of human memory., We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous., While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane., Its like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness., As is Linklaters custom, Boyhood is profound in such a casual way that its weighty themes feel nonchalant, effortless. This movie might make you cry for reasons you cant quite articulate. You wont be alone in feeling that way., Cinema has always been the best place for time travel, but rarely has it been so anchored in reality than in Richard Linklaters Boyhood., Linklater bridges the gap between these more art-oriented projects and contemporary narrative cinema. He offers us a new sense of knowing time by inviting us to be present as it unfurls., One of the loveliest things about Boyhood is how much of it makes those long-forgotten strings of childhood vibrate within you. It reminds you of what it was like to be a kid., A word about the films epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching., Linklaters casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce., Richard Linklaters Boyhood is in most respects a traditional realist film -- plainly shot, devoid of plot gimmicks, aiming to approximate life as it is actually lived., Watching the film, I wasnt exactly as moved as Id hoped I would be, and that was at first disappointing. But then I remembered that Richard Linklater doesnt really do big emotional indicating, that you have to listen a little closer., Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life., It\s the casual ease of Boyhood\s construction, its lack of a specifically lofty artistic objective, that makes it so effective., Boyhood is as immersive as it is observational, and at the same time inescapably self-reflective. In terms of manipulating the relationship between viewer and screen, there is nothing quite like it., This is an intimate, poignant film that makes you feel a little sad. But there are lots of loving and funny moments - such as when Mason and his kids campaign for Barack Obama - and the overall effect is life-affirming."
Tiger Orange,0,"Among the actors, Marcel has the most screen wattage, deftly conveying a full, interesting character despite very little to back him up., A small but well-observed character drama."
America: Imagine the World Without Her,0,"Theres no doubt that DSouza loves America, but he loves it much in the same way that we all do: According to a map of his own design., America would be simply annoying if it were just preaching to the choir; what makes it unendurable is the fact that D\Souza and Sullivan can\t craft a sermon that would keep even the choir awake, interested, and entertained., This is an unusually odious effort because it is so hugely hypocritical and ultimately self-serving., You could bother debating DSouza on history and semantics and rudimentary logic, but chances are youd end up feeling like Meathead arguing with Archie Bunker., Graced with a hilariously definitive title, America is astonishingly facile, a film comprised entirely of straw man arguments., Hilariously, just minutes after reducing Occupy Wall Street to an assault on small hamburger shops, DSouza attacks insurance companies and Wall Street executives as fellow travelers in Obamacare, this countrys one unpardonable sin., It\s Sesame Street-style show and tell, complete with highly suggestive musical cues., Throughout the film, we see DSouza walking through American landmarks, gravely studying them, deep in contemplation. It brings to mind the old joke about the government: Trust me. Im here to help., The cinematic equivalent of one of those forwarded e-mails of mostly discredited facts that you receive from an uncle ..., DSouza controls the conversation, and thus goes unchallenged when he tries to make real-world points with make-believe scenarios., Beholden to the same plethora of taboos, half-truths, and outright lies traded en masse by mainstream conservatism for the last seven years., For the most part ... DSouza gives the impression of someone obsessed with whitewashing any and all dark chapters in U.S. history books."
American Sniper,0,"The script and direction are unabashedly skewed towards feeding a lowest-common-denominator notion of war heroes and takes a righteous stand in favour of war, rather than exploring or portraying an authentic picture of the psychological impact..., For many, I suspect, American Sniper may be weirdly liberating-gratifying a perhaps hitherto unsuspected desire to see their pessimism, hopeless and unchanging, projected on the screen., Well-produced but flawed., Not only watchable, but quite good - the kind of lean, mean mediation on masculinity and duty that this particular filmmaker has always done so well., American Sniper cannot be reduced to simple pro- or anti-war labels., American Sniper has a perspective thats recognizable from the classic Westerns Eastwood has long been associated with, both as an actor and a director. Its an existential critique of violent machismo that doubles as a celebration of violence., Eastwood makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent., Clint Eastwoods American Sniper is an often lazy and somewhat hazy propaganda film about American heroism and hell in the Iraq War., Although Cooper succeeds in resembling and sounding like the real Kyle, this isnt some cheap impersonation trick. Cooper gives maybe the best performance of his career., Unlike the movie version of Chris Kyle who never makes a mistake, Eastwood and his writer are prone to flubs that cost them their fog of war stance., Cooper looks the part, having bulked up for it, but he cant do anything with the blandness of the character the script has given him., Weve seen it before, but Eastwood is good at making it seem raw and personal, largely by the care he takes in building a character, and the situations that will test them., Director Clint Eastwood deftly shows the mental and physical toll of heroism in a way that will leave you gutted., Eastwood has stripped things back so that we observe the action through American eyes only, our focus as blinkered as that of its titular killer., The 84-year-olds deep appreciation of the masculine -- its conflicts, its appeal, its evolving truths -- has added texture to our understanding of violence, warfare and more. At least as it is represented onscreen., Director Clint Eastwood continues his quiet critique of the moviegoers deep delight in cinematic violence., It may be admirable for Eastwood to have de-dramatised the material. But that doesnt make this hugely disappointing film any easier to sit through., American Sniper romanticizes Kyle, whose bestselling memoir, which put him on talk-show appearances, included boastful stories of dubious authenticity. What remains is distilled and dramatized, a story of loss, the story of the universal soldier., The fluidity and tension of the battle scenes is breathtaking, Eastwood at his cinematic best. But its the ever-tightening knot inside of Kyle the director really wants to understand., If American Sniper fails at being a truly great film, it is no fault of its star."
Tusk ,0,"Tusk opens with the sound of two men laughing at their own jokes, so I guess a doff of the cap is due to the filmmaker for encapsulating his movie so efficiently, right from the jump., Justin Long and Johnny Depp join the Clerks director for a weird, unpredictable movie that still feels like only Smith could have made it., Parts of it are funny, parts are suspenseful and parts of it - to put it mildly - are hideously awful. Horrible may be a better word than horrific., Nice as it would be to herald Tusk as a return to Smiths bold early period, the movie has a lurching tone and an airless atmosphere., Smith has always had a weakness for protracted dialogue, and in Parks he has a fitting muse., I thought this was a really pointless exercise., If Kevin Smith was stoned when he thought up his excellent walrusian nightmare, then marijuana is the best creative medicine., Excess is Smith\s middle name, so the show goes on . . . and on., Tusk is not a particularly good movie, but the vivid anxiety dream at its heart makes it one of the most personal films this writer-director has ever made., Tusk is an overextended, tonally incoherent joke that would make viewers squirm even if it didnt involve a bloody and demented medical experiment., If youre a Kevin Smith junkie, as I am, youll appreciate the verbal pinwheels he spins around the horror genre in Tusk., Had Smith been more disciplined, the films deliberately absurd plot twists might have been more alienating, and funny., A schizoid horror comedy with an identity crisis, shifting uncomfortably between shocking body horror and puerile Jackass-level cringe humor., The screenplay feels like a series of tweets. And the appearance of a big star in a wink-at-the-audience disguise is a distracting stunt., This tonal mishmash is a misfire of literally gross proportions., Smith seems to have been more charged up by the (profoundly ridiculous) ideas behind his movie than in making them work., Kevin Smith, of Clerks, delivers a weird in-joke inspired by one of his podcasts. You probably had to be there., You can imagine Mr. Smith and his collaborators rolling in the aisles at their own preposterousness. If you can find your inner 16-year-old, you might just join them., Take The Human Centipede and sprinkle liberally with the old Bob and Doug McKenzie sketches from SCTV and the result is Tusk, Kevin Smiths underbaked horror-comedy hybrid., It has a game cast, its watchable, fun, sick, sad and has to be seen to be believed."
Shaun the Sheep Movie,0,"Shaun will awaken the inner-tot in adults, and the inner-adult in tots., The Shaun the Sheep Movie manages to be smart, moving and hilarious without the inclusion of a single word of dialogue., A heartwarming, fun, smart experience is kneaded into a simple, delightful and insightful story., Plenty of bigger, more grown-up movies could learn a thing or two from its humanity., Shaun The Sheep is suitable entertainment for anyone who likes to laugh out loud., Visually appealing and animal friendly, Shaun the Sheep celebrates summer - a break in the routine, loving it on the lam., The sight gags are so meticulously designed that they often recall Rube Goldberg inventions; much of the fun derives from seeing how the filmmakers pull off their elaborate comic scenarios., Anyone who doesnt have a grand time watching Shaun the Sheep Movie is suffering from a fractured funny bone that needs to be reset., Grownups will enjoy every delicious irony and twisted sight gag that floats over kids heads. If the brats dont get the shout-outs to The Night of the Hunter, The Silence of the Lambs and Scorseses Cape Fear, let them suck on it., Another adorably quirky stop-motion animated film from Aardman., Whats ultimately endearing about Shaun the Sheep Movie is its message of loyalty and devotion. The resourcefulness and tenacity with which Shaun searches for the man he once took for granted is genuinely touching., The world of Shaun the Sheep puts a smile on my face before anything even happens., Clever bits, sight gags and situational slapstick will appeal to both kids and adults, especially the flocks problems carrying out smart sheep Shauns elaborate schemes., Who needs words when every frame is worth a thousand of them?, The movie could be studied as an encyclopedia of sight gags, most of which are well executed, if not entirely original (which wont matter to small-fry viewers)., Like a great amusement park ride, Shaun the Sheep Movie is consistently enjoyable., Every once in a while, the movie delivers a laugh big enough to dwarf its more modest charms-further emphasizing that this is junior-level Aardman., Some of the most pure visual storytelling youre going to see this year., Like a great silent movie, it creates its pathos and comedy out of the concrete objects being animated, building elaborate gags involving everyday items transformed into Rube Goldberg devices., Its a light, breezy movie -- fluffy, you might say -- that is clearly suitable even for pre-verbal viewers."
Jupiter Ascending,0,"No amount of visual pyrotechnics, no matter how spectacular, can save such a tired, weak story., The storytelling is clumsy, the characters are befuddling, and the Wachowskis action sequences - once so graceful and thrilling - are ugly, noisy, and worst of all, boring., Aggressively dull and terribly paced., Directors Lana and Andy Wachowski excel at creating fantastic new worlds lurking under the surface of our own, but in Jupiter Ascending, theyve overstuffed the turkey with too many tangents and false endings., Where were the Guardians of the Galaxy when we needed them? If only they had prevented the disastrous atrocity that is Jupiter Ascending from infiltrating Earth\s movie theaters before it was too late!, I still dont know what Jupiter Ascending is about but, wow, what a ride., A lot of people spent a lot of time and a lot of money making a lot of movie, but theres not much there., The Wachowskis create a churning, swooping C.G.I. universe thats decorated to the corners of the frame without taste or imagination., When it comes to bonkers, overcooked, overambitious sci-fi, writer/directors Andy and Lana Wachowski really are in a world of their own., Dont even get me started on the aliens, many of whom would have been turned away from the cantina door in Mos Eisley., Redmaynes farcical grandiosity harkens back to science-fiction serials of the 1930s, but unfortunately so does Jupiters passivity throughout the film., Jupiter Ascending is inane from first frame to last - the dialogue is so clunky, I wondered if George Lucas had been brought in to do the rewrite., Upon exiting, my wearied delight with Jupiter Ascending coexisted with pure bafflement. But I exited knowing that Id seen a movie no other filmmaker could have made., This sci-fi-inflected fantasy has many a wince-worthy romantic exchange between stars Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis., This movie often plays like a super-expensive, 21st-century version of one of those Star Wars knockoffs made around 1980 by people who weren\t George Lucas., Jupiter Ascendings early cleverness dries up quickly, especially when Kunis is offscreen, leaving us with just another incoherent sci-fi spectacle., This kind of pandering FX padding, unnurtured by humor or heart, is what shifts Jupiter Ascending from a shambles to a fiasco. The Wachowskis wind up where you never expected to find them creatively: on the ropes., A beautiful muddle from The Matrix-making Wachowski siblings., A big, woozy, spacey fairy tale with a science-fiction exoskeleton and a core of pure mush., Technically, I\m an alien, Mila Kunis voice-overs, by way of introduction to this epically kitschy space opera ..."
Accidental Love,0,"Its an unmitigated disaster, not even worth a spin as a curiosity piece., David O Russell has moved on, as should we all., Unsurprisingly, its a mess., For this kind of comedy to work, absolute precision and relentless speed are essential. Given the circumstances in which the was made, it is little surprise that neither are achieved., If there are David O Russell completists out there, this is something for them., Accidental Love fields a top-level cast in a low-level comedy that combines the peculiar subjects of a nail in the brain, and pork-barrel Washington politics., A smoking crater of a film ... the end result has vital scenes missing, no ending, and performances that often dont make sense., The misplaced screwball energy is wearying., The bastard offspring of a charmless romcom and a toothless political satire., Accidental Love is an utter mess, which is understandable given its troubled provenance. Its also fascinating., Really awful. Unwatchably awful. As in, Give it the Razzie now and be done with it awful., Forget the title. Accidental Release is more like it., So flimsily constructed that it resembles a middle-school play thats been hastily filmed on an antique camcorder., Very bad medicine indeed., The race for the worst film of 2015 is officially on., Big, broad political satire is hard to pull off in the best of cases., Squint hard enough and its possible to see the sharper, more inspired comedy David O. Russell might have made out of Accidental Love."
The Divergent Series: Insurgent,0,"The visually pleasing third act saves this movie from oblivion, as it progresses to a surprisingly fulfilling ending., In all, Insurgent may work as a deafening, frivolous diversion for viewers who can ignore the flimsiness of its universe, plot, and characters., People are sad, people are mad, people are bad, and people will say exactly how they feel any chance they get. Its like a Bond villain crafted specifically to destroy whatever mystery still existed around the inner angst of young adult stories., Insurgents convenient scanners affirm its heroine to be 100% Divergent, the most out of everyone, and thats good enough for the story. But it doesnt have to be good enough for the audience., There are some thrilling scenes here and there, but mostly, Insurgent is an aggressively familiar experience., A more efficient indifference generator than its predecessor., I appreciate the attempt to try to make this world -- an obliterated, totalitarian Chicago -- as watchable as possible. But theres too much to keep straight., Theres little substance and little depth, but Woodley, with her preternatural poise, offers a worthy simulation of drama., Schwentke cranks up the action enough to keep us distracted, with well-oiled scenes of renegades jumping freight trains, and simulated cliffhangers involving flying fiery buildings offering several edge-of-your-seat moments., Insurgent is far too long for the minimal plot it encapsulates, features little in the way of meaningful character development, and is riddled with instances of poorly conceived, contrived developments., Its all a bit of an unengaging muddle, covered over with concrete grunge, clean white labs, and stagy special effects., The dialogue is clunky, and other than Tris the characters are one-dimensional. Moreover, its all so earnest., The final Divergent book will be split into two movies, a future that is indeed a little dystopian. Much brighter, though, are the blossoming careers of Woodley and Teller., As a distillation of all thats most ordinary about contemporary young adult science fiction, it could hardly be bettered., It was always going to be hard to match the fire-power of The Hunger Games series, but the gap is now huge. If Mockingjay Part 1 resembles a playful, sharp-toothed canine, Insurgent is more like a slug., Insurgent is not a very good movie, but its better than it needs to be., Insurgent stubbornly fails to surge., Most of the best stuff is saved for Insurgent\s last half-hour, in which the movie goes lysergic, as on an acid trip., Unlike Divergent, which required pages of premise-establishing exposition, Insurgent is more purely action-centric, as the hunters hunt and the hunted flee through the trees, hopping freight trains, trying to elude capture., At times its just a weaponized vision of the highly cliquish tables at the high school cafeteria."
Tangerine ,0,"Their bond is largely what transforms another depressing Christmas in LA into a riotous adventure, even as it includes brothels, infidelity, meth, and kidnapping., I enjoyed it... But the way its set up, how its shot, the progression of the plot - its clear that it is offering up the story to a mostly white, bougie audience. It was voyeuristic in the worst possible way., Most of the movies slow-burning heat comes from Mya Taylors amazingly deep and deliberate - and often uproariously comedic - performance as Alexandra, I want to see these two actresses in other, better films--even if its just to erase Tangerine out of my head. They deserve better., Tangerine is spinning a tale of friendship and solidarity in the most unforgiving circumstances., At its core, this is a hilarious movie; it just happens to star two transgender women as the lead. That alone is worthy of note., As a formal exercise... Tangerine is nothing short of remarkable; as a portrait of people doing their best to be their best selves, its as warm and vivid as the sunsets splashed across its narrow but expansive digital canvas., Fired by zesty performances that crackle and burn with energy, Tangerine is a bittersweet affair underpinned by a winning sense of empathy and affection., Tangerine is a bit of a marvel, a low-budget film reportedly shot entirely on the iPhone 5 but one which combines extraordinary visual inventiveness, humour and pathos., Tangerine acknowledges that these are hard lives to lead, but the film ultimately stands as a celebration of the characters mad resolve., Tangerine takes you by the scruff of your neck into a parallel world where tattered reality is shot through with neon flashes of colour, clarity and pure emotional honesty., Its a long way from Pretty Woman., There is so much vitality and pizzazz, it seems almost by the by to point out that the whole film was shot on an iPhone., It may be known as The Movie Shot On An iPhone 5, but Sean Bakers hymn to the spirit of the streets has so much more going for it., It radiates a candour, immediacy and tongue-scalding sex appeal that a bigger budget would have only smothered., This is a one-crazy-night picture, a little like Alex Holdridges LA indie pic In Search of a Midnight Kiss, from 2007. Theres real energy., A dazzling bauble of melodrama and fast paced merriment., Raucously entertaining., Told with simplicity but deep empathy, Bakers film sports a refreshingly sober, grown-up worldview that refuses to judge, sensationalize, or do anything other than show lives as they may be, and perhaps are., Tangerine has generated interest partly because it was made using iPhones augmented by other devices. But technology can only take a film so far - it\s the story that really matters."
Love & Mercy ,0,"Demme is unrivalled at filming bands at play—and at noticing the folks who listen and dance along—and Streep’s part is worthy of her formidable gifts., Ricki And The Flash carries a maturity that her earlier films lacked... Despite that, the movie ends in a syrupy sweet reconciliation., Streep makes us care about Ricki even when shes being a stubborn jerk. Its another astonishing performance by her, in a film just good enough to deserve it., Its twinkly ads take pains to exclude its more compelling thematic elements. But theyre there, and worth seeking out through the fog of the other stuff., Rickis life may be chaotic but the film hits the high notes when it counts, in rambunctious, crowd-pleasing fashion., Without Streep at its centre, this might have seemed a flimsy confection. But she plays the rock singer with the utter conviction and fearlessness that she brings to all her roles, however unlikely they seem., Once you get past all that A-list glitz and heavyweight talent, damn if this shindig isnt lacking something in the lustre department., Meryl Streep lets it all hang out as a barroom rocker with family issues in this slight, enjoyable work-out., As ever, Streep is impressive, performing all her songs live and showing gruff attitude and a strong finale makes up for some mid-section flab., As fun as it is to watch Streep take on a grungy rocker persona, the novelty wears off pretty quickly. Fortunately, the ensemble cast hits the right notes., While its patly enjoyable as far as it goes, it might have risked something darker, a proper walk on the wild side., After Meryl Streep sang her dungarees off in Mamma Mia!, I had great hopes for Ricki and the Flash., No chore, and some fun, in an AOR-ish way., Likeable and surprisingly low-key., One of the best movies of the year, a tribute to the idea that anger and forgiveness arent mutually exclusive. Indeed, they sometimes go hand in hand., The movie is mature in the way it handles the regrets of absentee parents and the ways in which their children relate to them. Theres a little Hollywood artifice here but not so much that the emotions feel inauthentic., The movie may not be great, or even memorable, but I had a good time watching it... and that is no small compliment., Streeps latest mom role, as Ricki Rendazzo in Ricki and the Flash, has a light, Mamma Mia! vibe, but it still hits all those hot buttons., Despite Streeps best efforts, Ricki seems more of a contrivance than a flesh-and-blood character., The film, which Diablo Cody wrote and Jonathan Demme directed, is a work of bulk-size bogusness. Barely a single scene is convincing."
Pandemic ,0,"It does what it does quite capably ... maintaining a muscular, splattery propulsion that never descends into campily excessive gore or any other silliness despite the occasional flat line and plausibility lapse., He stages scenes as live-action video games to downplay the derivativeness of it all."
Queen of Katwe,0,"Queen of Katwe is still a bright addition to Disneys roster. As audiences and actors demand more complex roles for people of color, lets hope we see more groundbreaking projects like this one., Oyelowo and Nyongos performances temper the film with heart-wrenching emotion. And Mira Nairs touching portrait of Katwes inspiring young queen with a dream is one to remember., Overall, the film is not without its flaws. However, in the end, you arent just rooting for Phiona, but also for all of those who have found themselves in similar situations., For every clich the film indulges, another is skirted, and another subverted. By the end, every ounce of feelgood is deserved., When the feel good finish rolls round, you feel its been fully earned., The colors and rhythms of life in the slums of Uganda are what set Queen of Katwe apart from other underdog chess movies., Queen of Katwe mostly does what you expect it to do (albeit vivaciously). Then, like its Ugandan heroine, Phiona Mutesi, it jumps eight moves ahead., As feelgood stories of empowerment go, this has a ring of authenticity and mixes intelligence with irreducible emotional immediacy., This Disney drama manages to avoid patronising sentimentality with an uplifting and punchy look at the conflicts faced by 14-year-old Phiona., Its a fantastic, feelgood story; one that neatly conforms to the beats of a classic sporting underdog movie: think Rocky and the Rooks or The Bad News Bears with Bishops., A set of solid performances power this underdog flick to victory., We already know from his turn as Martin Luther King Jr in Selma that Oyelowo can be stirring in a statesmanlike role, but here he brings a similar kind of moral conviction to a far humbler underdog character., It is a thoroughly heartwarming story in which youre rooting so hard for the heroine that you scarcely notice how contrived some of Nairs dramatic gambits really are., Its a heartfelt movie, which makes up in warmth what it lacks in narrative originality., There is always something to tickle the eye., Its plot isnt going to win any prizes for originality, but Nair tells the story with immense warmth and cheer. You can see just about every move coming, but its making all the right ones., In some ways, the films streaks of realism-not fantasy-are what make it such a genuine pleasure to watch., I loved the way that the film shows so much patience, that it allows things to develop at their own naturalistic pace., Director Mira Nair knows just how to deploy her excellent cast, giving weight to the drama of both Mom and coach without ever forgetting her sweet young queen., Predictable and very Disneyfied, but Mutesis remarkable story carries the day."
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,0,"The emotional component is cheapened, at least partially, inserting a level of bad taste into the proceedings I found difficult to get past., Makes American Sniper look positively pacifist by comparison., Punishingly paced, flimsily constructed, and tackily executed, with the subtlety and panache of a third-rate 1930s melodrama., If you are looking for an immersive action thriller, this will do the trick., Bay certainly has a style of his own, albeit one that again harks back to the 1980s -- an even more cartoonish variant on the music-video bombast pioneered by directors such as Tony Scott., Unsurprisingly, survivors of the incidents depicted have dismissed the film as utter nonsense. Even if this were not the case, the film-makers have some explaining to do to the military folks Bay presumably seeks to honour., I went into the film knowing almost nothing about the September 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya and came out knowing even less., 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a movie for anyone who saw The Hurt Locker and thought, You know what would make this really good? If they got six really muscley dudes with machineguns to come in and blow away all the Arabs., Its undeniably spectacular in its own juddering, pyrotechnical, Armageddon-ish fashion, but its also a film that leads a very rancid taste., The title should give you some idea of how long this two-and-a-half hour film really feels., Once you get past the suspicion that hes going to glance wearily into the camera at any moment, Krasinski is highly believable as the semi-reluctant combatant in a battle that looks impossible to win., Everything youd expect from Bay is here with bells on - the macho provocation, the sound and fury, and the diabolical pleasure in reducing everything to rubble and bloody mush., Its all so hateful. Hates women. Hates talking. Hates tact. Loves guns., The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully, that artist will possess at least half of Bays punishing, peerless craft., The movie is imperfect and overlong but its never boring. And, although aspects of its factual accuracy can be called into question, it does a decent job of chronicling what happened that night., Several critics have given 13 Hours a pass, citing Bays skill at action engineering. Its his failure at everything else that makes this movie as hard to endure as it is impossible to believe. #helpme, Bay does well here what he always does well: He keeps the action at full throttle. This is also what he does so annoyingly: He always keeps things at full throttle., Bay is hell on manly banter amid the explosions (Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi), and also moments carefully calculated to make you feel the horrors - and the heroics - of war. Emphasis on calculated., Bay\s action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever, but his reductive worldview is also on display. 13 Hours doesn\t just lionize its American soldiers, it oozes disdain for everyone else., 13 Hours presents itself as a straightforward war film, but thats the last thing a subject this complex needed."
Inferno ,0,"The real plague: The pervasive sexism that creeps into every aspect of this plot., When you want to put down Sky Mall for a few minutes, Inferno will be right there, on the back of the seat in front of you., Inferno is better than The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons, but both of those films set the bar reprehensibly low., The best I can offer is the damning of faint praise: Inferno is a modestly entertaining diversion., A globe-trotting mystery thats a good deal less challenging than they believe., Its a lot more like a tweed-jacket version of Bond or Bourne or most any other thriller out there. But if Langdon is distinguished from the other globe-trotting saviors by his PhD, why arent his movies smarter?, Unless you are a Dante scholar, and perhaps not even then, following Inferno is a wild goose chase - without the goose., Heres hoping all involved are done making these Dan Brown adaptations, because I seriously doubt I have the desire or the energy to try and sit through another one anytime soon., Inferno has no sense of wonder at all, no respect for the weight of its conclusions. Cheap tricks and symbols are all it has., Ron Howards mostly lame adaptation of Dan Browns wholly lame novel., You know youve made some poor cinematic choices when you have to make Dan Brown characters less complex., A stylish but tedious thriller that never does catch fire., You don\t need a hidden set of clues to decipher that Inferno is one of the worst movies of the year., One action scene is underwater, but the rest of it drags so much it feels like it might be, too., Nothing is what it seems, unless it seems ridiculous, in which case its exactly what it seems., A thoroughly pedestrian adventure that might have been better titled Hell is Lots and Lots of Other People., Inferno is a grabber, and Hanks knows Langdon so well, he wears that character like a somewhat worn yet still well-constructed suit of clothes., The story may not make any sense, but theyre going to throw so much at you - so many jumpy moves, so many tangled threads - that you might not notice (or care)., It might seem that Dan Brown takes his art-history/conspiracy thrillers very seriously. Yet theres one clue, hidden in plain sight, that he doesnt: He keeps letting director Ron Howard turn them into silly movies., Silly and implausible, but mostly watchable."
Patriots Day ,0,"Patriots Day is a surprisingly steady retelling of a tragic event., A taut, multi-stranded account of the Boston marathon bombing., Its not suspenseful so much as commemorative and even, in paying tribute to the resilient spirit of Boston and all of those caught up in this attack, celebratory. Its a kind of civic tribute., This movie chronicles the hours before the bombing and the manhunt over the days afterwards, often in forensic detail, combining traditional crime-thriller drama with real CCTV, news and mobile phone footage., The strong narrative pulse overrides the irritation of Wahlbergs blue-collar alpha-saint., The hard-drive details of the days horror stay with you., Patriots Day is stirring, well-acted, moving and built with conviction and flair., The first half hour of Patriots Day is riveting., Berg deserves more recognition than he gets - hes Michael Bay with a social conscience., The third part of Bergs unofficial Americans-in-crisis trilogy will play better for US audiences than overseas, but its still a pacy and often enthralling disaster movie., As Berg demonstrated in his last film, Deepwater Horizon, he knows how to find his way around a broad canvas., Much of this feels familiar or worse, especially the cringeworthy finale., A great strength of this film is a focus on extended scenes, some quiet, some explosive, ones that remind me of the best recent television such as True Detective., A surprisingly solid thriller, Patriots Day paints a compelling picture of a city in crisis but fails to strike the right balance between fact and fiction., Patriots Day touches on vast phenomena, looking at an event that packs a huge amount of modern mental space in its crisp narrative confines. That\s why its blandly reductive simplicity is all the more unfortunate., The kind of all-star disaster movie you mightve seen in the 70s (with photos of Simmons, Goodman, Bacon, and the rest of the supporting players lined up in a neat row at the bottom of the poster), complete with half-baked backstories and dopey romances., A gripping, tense drama centered on a man who exemplifies American values of decency and integrity and shows exceptional ability to rise to the occasion., A film content with the charming, if chuckleheaded, cartoon of the Boston local that Wahlberg has regularly inhabited throughout his career., The film, which swivels frantically between first responders, survivors, and investigators, has a percussive force., An efficient and intense thriller that mines the best tropes of the chase genre."
Why Him?,0,"If the film drags a little at the end, its perhaps because the film-makers were enjoying the company of these characters as much as the audience undoubtedly will., Why Him? has all the flaws youd expect, from the non-existent visual style to the shortchanging of the women in the cast., We do not predict a lifespan to compare with that of Meet the Parents., Im not going to lie. I laughed - just not as frequently or as hard as I would have liked to., This is modern, old-fashioned fun, and I hope Franco keeps making films such as this., Too much of this comedy feels rushed and slapped together., It all works in theory. But the executions off., Uneven but funny enough ..., Like Meet the Parents, but littered with F-bombs, Why Him? is a holiday comedy that never quite figures itself out., I was not expecting to enjoy this film, but I have to admit, Why Him? is likeable and funny. While the film isnt destined to be a critical darling, it succeeded in making me laugh, For this puerile farce, director John Hamburg recycles a tired premise -- a straitlaced father disapproves of his daughters freewheeling boyfriend -- and then drowns it in moose urine (really)., Luckily for Franco, Cranston makes for the perfect comic foil in Why Him?. That craggy, lived-in face can launch a thousand laughs with a simple squint of the eye, cock of the brow, or clinch of the jaw., Why Him? is a guffaw-inducing comedy from the Meet the Parents franchise writer John Hamburg, who brazenly cannibalises his own material with mostly pleasing results., Hamburgs always reaching for poo-based humour in his more desperate moments - fully a third of his worst movie, Along Came Polly, was spent hanging out in loo cubicles with Ben Stillers irritable bowels. Must we again?, A disposable bit of Yuletide fun., What say we tiptoe quietly away and pretend this movie never happened?, Fans of ribald, gross-out humour looking for light seasonal fare with a mildly redemptive message will find Why Him? a wildly entertaining jaunt., Why Him? doesnt reinvent the raunchy Christmas-themed comedy, but like a visit home for the holidays, it proves to be (oddly) comforting., Why Him? may be the funniest new film youll see this or any other Christmas., Why watch Why Him?"
Midnight Special ,0,"The heavens keep splitting to deliver forked tinsel masquerading as sci-fi lightning., Nichols does so many things so well, and all at once, that it sort of takes your breath away., There is an adrenaline-fueled elasticity to events that is as smooth as it is exhilarating, all of it given extra potency thanks to the emotional complexities driving things to their conclusion., Midnight Special is a film about fatherhood and faith, with sci-fi elements that are engrossing, mysterious, and will linger with viewers for a long time., Director Jeff Nichols has created a bleak world confronted with the real prospect of hope, but only if you let yourself believe in it., Riffing on John Carpenters Starman, writer-director Jeff Nichols has crafted a sci-fi chase film whose gravely naturalistic style adds to its sense of portent., Weirder stuff begins happening, but thats best left to the movies telling rather than mine., Nichols is a director who isnt afraid to leave questions unanswered. I left the cinema thinking a lot about what I saw., Nothing about this theme is particularly interesting or new, and its still an open question how far Nichols can be ranked as an original creator as opposed to a prize pupil. Still, theres no doubting his craft and ambition., Overall, this is a tremendous film - narratively satisfying, visually striking, and with a teasing theological subtext, if thats your bag., This is a film that draws you in even as it perplexes you and that ultimately has a very strong emotional kick., The eventual release from oppression feels a little forced, but Midnight Special lays hooks that stay imbedded in anxious parts of the brain., Nichols has earned the right to take big leaps. Even if he doesnt stick the landing, its a thrill watching him try. He, too, is something special., Some films exist entirely on their own terms, while others benefit from a bit of backstory., Midnight Special starts strongly, and finishes nowhere very interesting., The shortcomings of Nichollss movie help throw into sharp relief exactly what it was that Spielberg got so right., Nichols is the kind of director who favours the slow burn over the instant payoff, meaning that the high-tension, low-drama manner in which his modern-day parable unfolds makes the third-act fireworks even more dazzling., You watch helplessly as the movie goes off the rails, the suspense and excitement leaking out of the enormous tension the early scenes had generated., Soulful sci-fi. A tribute to 80s classics, but with a 21st-century twist: Close Encounters of a new kind., It all sounds terribly murky, but few filmmakers are as gifted at making you want to peer through the murk."
Hacksaw Ridge,0,"Gibsons robust directorial technique brings an undeniable punch to the combat scenes ... Elsewhere in the film, however, theres a sledgehammer lack of subtlety that is only partially mitigated by Andrew Garfields impressive performance., If they gave out awards for most movie in a movie, then no other movie need turn up., A rousing tale of Pacific War heroism that has more in common with jingoistic Wayne staples such as Sands of Iwo Jima or The Green Berets than anything in the 21st century, this is wearily formulaic film-making., Vintage Mel-odrama., Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned war film, melded with a kind of new-fashioned explicitly violent drama., Mel Gibsons Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best Second World War movies since Terrence Malicks The Thin Red Line. It is also a wildly contradictory affair, combining folksiness with a pathological quality., A sterling modern war picture with an intriguing moral twist., Occasionally soapy on the homefront but cataclysmic in combat, this is a worthy addition to the WWII canon., Hacksaw Ridge, the first movie Mel Gibson has directed in a decade, is about as Mel Gibson as you can get: grisly, devout, and patriotic, with a deeply complicated core., A fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd., Gibson has made a movie thats nearly pathological in its love of violence-but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks., Hacksaw Ridge is a fine motion picture, one whose themes and ideas obviously speak to the filmmaker, and if Doss story has helped change him as far as being a decent human being is concerned, that makes it all even better., As director, Gibsons approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera., For the sheer spectacle of the battle scenes, Hacksaw Ridge will go down as one of Gibsons finest contributions to cinema., By the time Hacksaw Ridge reaches its necessary messianic finish, its hard to not be moved by the boggling heroism of this dutiful man., War is hell, but Hacksaw Ridge sacrifices that truth in favour of something far more insincere., The battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge are among the most violent captured on film - and also the most urgent., The scenes in battle are as harrowing as any ever put on screen. We are in the midst of utter carnage and chaos., Hacksaw Ridge is being touted as Gibsons comeback. Is it also an atonement? Whats clear is that Gibson has made a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put to the test in an arena of violent conflict - a movie you dont want to miss., If the films director were anyone but Gibson, a fixture on or even atop Hollywoods enemies list, it would be expecting several Oscar nominations."
Valley of Bones,0,"This earnest quasi-crime thriller, directed by Dan Glaser, takes too long to gain momentum and deliver the requisite action and suspense."
Once Upon a Time in Venice,0,"That hissing sound you hear is the air being let out of Bruce Willis as he struggles mightily to reconnect with once-vital action-comedy chops in the dim, unfunny Once Upon a Time in Venice., Of course Willis employs his trademark smirk and his familiar sarcastic line readings. Of course weve seen him play variations on this downtrodden, wisecracking cynic in better movies. But B-movie Willis is still kind of a hoot., Once Upon a Time in Venice frequently sags underneath its own general lethargy, and not even the snarkiest John McClane can fix that., Its as much a snapshot of a screwball neighborhood as it is a loose-ended shaggy dog story, with a weird, buoyant spirit that lifts it up over its somewhat sloppy storytelling., Bruce Willis barks up a number of wrong trees in this scattered, only sparsely amusing shaggy-dog mystery., Bruce, youre better than this., Bruce Willis\ latest effort to dislodge his film career from a stubborn rut goes unrewarded with Once Upon a Time in Venice, a wincingly unfunny comedy caper set along L.A.\s funky beach community., A tiresome imitation of smart-alecky Shane Black whodunits like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Last Boy Scout., A bunch of well-known faces look lost in Once Upon a Time in Venice, which is billed as an action-comedy but has little comedy and less action."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",0,"Its a brilliant performance in a film thats an honorable misstep., Theres an interesting drama in there, but it has not been given time to fight its way out of the semi-digested mulch all around., We dont learn very much about Israels relationships or motivations from the screenplay, but its fascinating to watch Washingtons display of repressed turmoil., The results are entertaining and watchable, but always slightly, oddly out of sync with the eponymous turn., A Washington vehicle in the purest sense, one whose whole reason for being is the fact that hes in it., Through his sheer learned technique and presence, Washington sells this one., It ends in a very unsatisfactory way but that doesnt take away from the mercurial originality of Washingtons performance., Clearly conceived as a morality play, the awkwardly titled film is too contrived and predictable to efficiently deliver the emotional punch it aims for., Like a Perry Mason episode that has accidentally collided with Philadelphia., Denzel Washington is perfectly good but the script doesnt give him enough to make this worthy of all the attention., A worthy but wordy look at the inequities of the US legal system, saved by a handful of terrific scenes and a tour-de-force turn from Washington., One of the best performances of Washingtons career., Roman J. Isreal, Esq. isnt just a narrative about how three weeks can dramatically change your life, its a tale about the things we tell ourselves and how desire and excess can seduce even the most humble among us., Its a credit to Washingtons rock solid performance that we care as much as we do., ... the weird thing is, as gripping as all of this is in concept, in execution its oddly dull., Part character study, part legal thriller and part morality tale about means manifesting their own ends, Roman J. Israel, Esq. winds up being just as eccentric and unpredictable as its doggedly honorable, and far from perfect, leading man., You cant stop watching Washington - and you cant stop wishing he didnt have to work so hard to keep the story together once it starts branching out in different directions., Whats even harder to take seriously is the films late shift into genre territory, which includes the most shameless and unnecessary car chase Ive seen in a long time., Roman J. Israel, Esq. has pockets of intrigue, and writer-director Gilroy and Washington have teamed up to create a promising dramatic character. We just never get full delivery on that promise., The story is surprisingly unfocused and, when it snaps out of the protracted setup phase, it plunges into quasi-thriller territory that relies on a series of hard-to-swallow contrivances."
Pitch Perfect 3,0,"Pitch Perfect 3 does have elements that reconnect you to the charm of the original idea, but its so out of tune that you are almost thankful for the final curtain call., The third round of the Bellas is basically a bland, very-occasionally-bubbling-to-the-surface, not-enough-laughs comedy., I also really liked the closing musical number quite a little bit, and if Pitch Perfect 3 ends up being the Bellas a cappella swan song, for my part I cant help but feel the entire group goes out on something of a satisfying high note., Pitch Perfect 3 is so breezy its completely weightless, but it manages to deliver just enough of the goods., A-ca-trocious., A typically winning central turn from Kendrick and some Pitch Perfect staples just about save the day., Pitch Perfect 3 moves too much into comedy-action territory to truly feel like the scrappy musical this trilogy started out being., This swan song is in serious need of some Auto-Tune., When a franchise descends to jokes about how its run out of ideas, and setting things on fire, not once but twice, its one movie past time to stop., As a whole, Pitch Perfect 3 feels like an encore nobody asked for., The movie is best when it\s focused on the music (prepare to hear the dorkiest version of Toxic more times than is healthy), not the silly subplots that have a way of sprouting up around third chapters., The final pitch is a big miss., The wafer-thin plot barely sustains the songs and romance., Although I do think PP fans will be satisfied with the finale, lets hope this is the last redux for these pitches., Aca-nough already., These are presumably independent young adults - most of the lead actresses are in their 30s now - continuing to wrestle with 18-year-old problems. And when they finally take the stage, its hard to care., An off-key dismantling of what made the concept work in the first place., Rebel Wilson\s sassy fightin\ moves during a gleefully preposterous hostage rescue jumpstart Pitch Perfect 3 when even the trilogy capper\s signature a cappella sometimes can\t., A coarse, ugly, pointlessly action-packed reminder that every modestly sharp and amusing property must eventually be converted, by the commercial logic of Hollywood, into a soul-killing cash grab., With a plot as unfocused as its freshly graduated characters, the shaggy Pitch Perfect 3 gets by on karaoke logic: What makes for a good time isn\t the song you sing, but the company you keep."
Buena Vista Social Club: Adios,0,"A thoughtful if somewhat scattered documentary ..., ... Cubas geriatric music troupe get a touching send-off in Lucy Walkers hagiographic but moving documentary., Adios feels both disorganized and unnecessary, like an encore staged after the house lights have gone up and most of the audience has exited the building., The approach is pretty conventional, but the characters are so brilliant youd struggle not to be swept up in it all., Unfortunately, Lucy Walker\s Buena Vista Social Club: Adios plays more like a well-intentioned but unsatisfying addendum to Wenders\ movie and Cooder\s recording., After Adios, many longtime fans will want to chase the taste away with a stiff shot of the old stuff., Despite any shackles, social or otherwise, music will always serve as a mode of liberation, an expression of love, and Buena Vista Social Club: Adios passionately asserts that idea., Ultimately, Adios transcends politics and proves once again that music knows no boundaries., Adios is less engaging than Walkers earlier work, with little of the poeticism she displayed in Waste Land and The Crash Reel. It surely doesnt help that shes stuck picking through Wenders leftovers ..., When you remember something, one of the group members says at one point, it\s because your spirit is in it. And there\s plenty of spirit kicking around inside Buena Vista Social Club: Adios., Adios just feels inessential-more of a bloated DVD supplement (it would have been perfect, in shorter form, for the recent Criterion release of Wenders film) than a proper movie in its own right., Lucy Walkers film is at its most incisive when it explores the historical development of son music., Both an exemplary sequel and a vital, informative companion piece."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,0,"One can only hope Perry will move on to another holiday and perhaps take the effort to reconnect with the crazy old-lady persona that has served him so well. Until then: Oh hail, no., If nothing else, and there really isnt much else, this feature provides a startling glimpse into the interiors of Perrys imagination., While its predecessor at least pleased his fans, writer-director-star Perrys latest offers few laughs and embarrassing post-production work., This movie finds Mr. Perry, never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking, drastically off whatever his best game is., Its already a general rule that Madea movies are never all that funny whenever Madea isnt on screen, but even when she and Joe are at the center of the action, theyre batting about .250 when it comes to punchlines., Like Madea, Perrys getting away with attempted murder., In the end, the scariest thing about Boo 2! is the idea that A Madea Easter might be next., Even if youre just looking for a Tyler Perry night out, be very afraid."
Transformers: The Last Knight,0,"An exhausting distillation of everything that can possibly go wrong with a blockbuster., Michael Bay has promised that this is the last Transformers movie he will direct, which is no small relief. It will not, alas, be the last Transformers movie., Transformers: The Last Knight is the pinnacle of summer blockbuster stupidity. The only thing that could top it is another Transformers sequel, a nightmare to imagine., The end of the world cant come soon enough in Transformers: The Last Knight., Though convoluted and mostly indistinguishable from piffle, its by no means the worst of the bunch., Regardless of our opinions, we all know what a Michael Bay film is. This ones his most Baysome., Perhaps you need to be huffing petrol fumes (or whatever it is that the autobots run on) but 149 minutes have rarely felt so interminable., I can barely summon a feeling about The Last Knight; if anything, I feel slightly worried about how little I hated it., Im not sure theyre even trying anymore., The pinnacle of blockbuster gigantism, Bays latest is a chore except when its madness becomes so sensorially all-consuming -- blinding the eyes, deafening the ears, befuddling the mind -- that it achieves a sort of terrible abstract grandeur., This film just doesnt stop moving. The camera swirls around every shoot-out, every fight, every conversation. Nothing is still. Everyone shouts. The tone is hysterical and everyone is angry., A movie thats cut like the worlds longest and most tedious trailer, pinballing from scene to scene and rarely spending more than a few seconds on any single shot., This latest entry is simply dumb, dull, and pointless., I am not going to try to explain the story- after watching this movie I may never try to explain another story ever again., All the best moments in the movie-pure images, devoid of symbol and, for that matter, nearly empty of sense-go by too fast, are held too briefly, are developed too little., Distilled to its essence, The Last Knight is an orgy of incoherence, a sensory assault that suffocates the viewer in a cavalcade of special effects incontinence., Every time Michael Bay directs another Transformers abomination (this is the fifth), the movies die a little. This one makes the summers other blockbuster misfires look like masterpieces., Elsewhere, its business as usual. Sparks fly, smoke drifts. Gleaming bodies, human and mechanical, loom over us, often set against pristine blue sky., Michael Bay is back with another mammoth budget to throw at the screen in the latest Transformers monstrosity., Insultingly poor."
Liz and the Blue Bird,0,"Yamada has a very keen eye for depicting adolescent malaise in visually evocative terms, and Liz and the Blue Bird could have benefited from even more flights of fancy than she allows for here., The sequences illustrating the fairy tale are rendered in a handsome water color style, but even these scenes feel too slow and deliberate to enliven the film., Whats most impressive is that Yamada gives delicate life to a wafer-thin story of two friends drifting apart. Without ever feeling choppy or over edited, the shots are composed in microscopic detail."
Forever My Girl,0,"There is more pleasure to be had in the dwindling returns of CMTs Nashville than in this country soap-opera., The lead actors are very pretty., It all feels a little bit off, as if every third scene was cut out randomly, and every camera angle came down to a fourth choice., Sentimental dreck of the fluffiest order., Forever My Girl is barely a step above a Lifetime movie., The problem is not the well-worn plot or familiar characters, but the fact that Wolf adds no depth or complication to either that would make the film her own., For an audience, seeking fluffy, escapist, country music-tinged romance, itll hit a sweet spot., Rothe was a standout in last years horror comedy Happy Death Day, but the Denver-born actors performance here as Josie is as coolly bland as overnight oats., Bethany Ashton Wolf\s Forever My Girl is less reminiscent of a country song than of Radiohead\s True Love Waits., Pretty people with pretty problems will always be playing on a screen somewhere, but this one is better suited for watching while folding laundry., A by-the-book redemption story for a guy who hardly deserves it., Roe and Rothe are nice enough to look at, but together, theres no spark, and separate, little evidence of an interior life., The country-fried romance written and directed by Bethany Ashton Wolf becomes a victim of self sabotage as it nears its (predictable) conclusion, removing any good will it created in its first half., Just about anyone with a level head would see Forever My Girl as the story of a narcissist manipulating a naive doormat., Forever My Girl is a bad movie, pure and simple., Call this schmaltzy romantic drama Nicholas Sparks Lite, and you wont be far off the mark., The two leads are both highly appealing, with Roe credible as a country music superstar., A Hallmark movie would have at least given the female lead something of a personality and plot arc; this movies all about the celebrity and his emotional journey, while the woman stands around like a prize waiting to be won, the Blessed Hometown Honey., Wolf is a Louisiana native and obviously loves her location work, but not enough to imbue the writing or visuals with any life., Wolf establishes only a half-formed idea of the decisions, fights, and silences that have shaped these characters lives, so the cast often seems to be shouting into a vacuum."
Monster Family,0,"Monster Hunt 2 is so perfectly good-natured and so utterly nonsensical that it makes not-thinking-about-it basically an act of self-preservation, for which, bless its bouncing, gurgling, flolloping heart., Monster Hunt 2 is equally charming, sweet, slight, and unmemorable., Monster Hunt 2 ultimately shapes up as more of a stopgap effort to showcase the franchises possibilities and stir up interest for its grand denouement."
A Simple Favor ,0,"Imagine an ABC sitcom based on David Finchers Gone Girl, and youll get an idea of what this lightweight comic mystery is like., It seeks only to entertain, and in its haphazard way it does., A deeply confused movie that feels like a mash-up of Mean Girls and an episode of Law and Order., As intoxicating as the mid-afternoon martinis swilled by the two central characters., The two leads are both absolutely sinking their teeth into this... slightly bitter cocktail and doing it with a sense of relish., This half-baked missing persons thriller...gamely attempts to reinvent the careers of its two stars and its director, but isnt nearly dark, nasty or tough enough., Kendrick and Lively have never been funnier, snapping one-liners at each other like elastic bands; the script is hyper-alert to the undercurrent of competitiveness between stay-at-home and working mums., With its saucy French pop music and pastel Saul Bass-inspired credits, this film is so hungry to seem like a classic thriller that you come away charmed by its pure-hearted ambition., Its clash in storytelling styles is bracing and original., Its a Mommi murder mystery that knows exactly how ridiculous is, the whole cast in on the joke., A Simple Favour doesnt add up to a filling meal, but with the drinks this zingy and a wicked canapé game, it still tickles the tastebuds plenty., Watching Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick trade barbs is entertaining, but Feigs first thriller suffers from an unconvincing plot and inconsistent tone., Tonally mismatched - but Kendrick and Lively are just about compelling enough to pull it off., While Feigs neo-noir soap opera fizzes with comedy camp, Jessica Sharzers script is spiked with acid wit and chilling nastiness., Until an ending that flies ruinously off the rails, Paul Feigs bouncy comedy-thriller brings out the scrappy best in Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively and offers an unexpected take on the twists and turns of female friendship., The performances by Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively are so invigorating, so generous with pointed inflections and snappy gestures, that they fill the movies good-humored, amply plotted emptiness., The biggest favours come from the stars, Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, who deliver two of the best lead actress performances Ive seen in a while., Director Paul Feig doesnt seem able to decide whether hes making a slightly outré crime comedy, a blithely twisted relationship thriller, a brightly lit horror melodrama, or maybe an arch meta-take on all three., Paul Fieg brings an elegant old Hollywood gravitas to the proceedings while never undercutting the more playfully juvenile elements that make the film so much fun., The gradual transformations they both undertake play out in their wardrobes, which the characters treat as costumes, as armor, and as commentary."
Game Night ,0,"The long joke of the narrative is adroitly handled, and for once the climax pays off in laughs., The movie is a hollow throwback to classic comedy, and it shines only by contrast with dull studio competition., The spoofy action set-pieces are ho hum. Whats special is the minutiae-based, casually political banter., This surprisingly zingy, throwback studio comedy is witty and observant on the dynamics between couples., The closest thing we have seen in recent years to a successful exercise in high screwball., Its clever, silly, slick and fun., The film not only manages to deliver the goods with its fantastically-crafted comedic narrative, but also succeeds in highlighting what weve been missing these last few years, simple and effective gags delivered with gusto and great timing., Delivers all the undemanding laughs you could wish, and has such a plot of such baroque intricacy that it even manages a few genuine shocks., The raucous energy of the early scenes isnt sustained and the film becomes increasingly repetitious and silly. The comedy elements here work far better than the thriller ones., Its a one-note black comedy. But one is better than none, and this note is high, passably sharp and could crack the odd martini glass., Beats a game of Risk any day., Its very funny, with a script by Mark Perez, and all the pieces fit together like a perfect Rubix cube., With its clever, whip-smart script and enthusiastic ensemble cast firing on all cylinders, crime comedy filmmakers Jonathan Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein score big with Game Night., Game Night is canny enough to go full-throttle with the absurd and not bother trying to do much with its meager dramatic and/or sentimental elements., But Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are a superb comedic pair, the two actors playing off of one another as if theyve been doing it their whole careers., The back and forth between McAdams and Bateman is what makes Game Night sing (which is not to slight Horgans dry wit or Magnussens elegant idiocy or Morris magnificent Denzel Washington impression)., The clever American comic thriller Game Night is a bit like a matryoshka doll. There are stories within stories and, just when it looks like the final doll has been revealed, there is another twist to keep the game going., Theres a slapstick sequence made to look like a single take, where bravura filmmaking services hilarity and excitement, Thanks to winning performances from Bateman and McAdams, it is watchable, with a few clever twists and across the board strong support from the cast., Game Night is a blast, a sharp adult comedy that earns genuine laughs without going lowbrow or diving into raunchy humor."
Suspiria ,0,"Guadagnino claims that his Suspiria is not a remake at all but a cover version. If thats the case, it can only be the equivalent of turning a three-minute glam stomp into a bloated rock opera., Suspiria is Its Own Beast, Casting a Hypnotic Spell Thats Sure to Divide Audiences, Kajganich is a purveyor of pretentious piffle., It sounds intriguing (and at times it is), yet too often the result is clunkily mechanical, tending occasionally toward the risible., The current Suspiria is always on the point of becoming interesting, but it never fails to squander that potential., Whilst the Argento was a movie that leapt and flew, this is a movie that sits there and tells you off., Suspiria is a classy, tinglingly stylish, charismatically acted yet chilly affair that crescendos madly in the final act (surged on by Thom Yorkes score) into a frenzied, full-frontal, Grand Guignol finale., Suspiria is too long, too empty with false fullness - those big themes that swell the stomach while providing no nutrition - and too keen to be visually and viscerally delinquent at every opportunity., A beautiful, resonant feminist fairy tale at least half grounded in German postwar realities., This isnt an atrocity on the level of, say, Rob Zombies Halloween - but it is a horror designed to test your patience rather than your nerves., What makes the new film compelling viewing is the extraordinary contribution of Swinton, who plays three roles in the movie., If you let yourself be taken over by its sinister spell, youll be in for an unforgettable experience., Popular genres start to die the moment they become respectable and in that light, Luca Guadagninos gory Suspiria is all the confirmation needed that the golden era of the splatter movie belongs to the past., The new element that resonated with me the most was the sense of history and survival -- the strength and resolve of this female collective making quite political art for 30 years., Suspiria is a statement and a question, at once. And, one of the best films of the year., Ambitious, grandiose, occasionally compelling but far more often irritating and laughable., The Argento is a marvel of style-as-subject; Guadagnino subjects audiences to second-hand shocks., The filmmakers insatiable curiosity and grandiose sense of spectacle keeps Suspiria from becoming half as annoying as it should be., Dull-witted ostentation abounds in Guadagninos Suspiria... Suspiria 2018 assaults the eye, distresses the ear, and maligns the mind., This is likely the love it-hate it event epic of 2018, and I cant imagine well see its like again soon at any point in the foreseeable future."
The Obituary of Tunde Johnson,0,"I was so impressed by the way it found a totally inspired avenue into the familiar Groundhog Day structure., The Obituary of Tunde Johnson takes an eerily unique and effective aim at the ongoing slaughter of young black men by white police officers. Tunde stands in for those whose keening obituaries weve already read., An agonizing tale about the weight society hoists upon too many black gay mens weary shoulders, its the kind of film that lingers in your mind days after youve seen it, as much due to the relevant subject matter as to Tundes penetrating gaze., The cumulative assassinations begin to ache like a mysterious bruise, making the audience feel the psychic weight of living in fear. Yet, the style of the film is more teen soap opera than vérité miserablism."
Hustlers ,0,"Hustlers is a triumph., Its easy to get lost in the visceral joy that comes with watching women move this way., A heist thriller-cross-social drama, Hustlers weight is wrapped in the veneer of diamantés and stilettos, but there is real substance here., ...the script and plot are dull and obvious. The attempted humour is anything but funny., The hard-boiled exchanges between the women have a genuine exuberance, recalling Hollywood movies of the 1930s where showgirls trade wisecracks backstage., As good as Lopez and her onscreen accomplice Constance Wu are, they cant act what isnt in the script; other than a dedicated work ethic, were never given access to their thoughts., Through the peephole of Lorene Scafarias camera, a world pirouetting on and catering to the male gratification becomes a joyous playground for womens empowerment., So here come words we werent necessarily expecting to write : give Jennifer Lopez the freaking Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress right now., With a refreshingly dynamic soundtrack and impressive costume design, its fair to say that almost everything about the film works as intended, It understands its characters, understands its world...its fun, and I thought Jennifer Lopez was very, very good., Hustlers recreates the riveting crime story for a semisweet feel-good movie thats entertaining from start to finish., Hustlers is arguably the finest performance Jennifer Lopez has ever given, and there is no way for me to be unbiased about that fact. Her performance is as magnetic as it is layered, loving and warm as it is fearsome and dangerous., Constance Wu, Mette Towley, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart and a cameo by ex-stripper Cardi B add magic as the women go from self-help, to self-employment, to self-infliction., Jennifer Lopez is just absolutely astounding in every single way., Lopez is captivating with all the right moves, and theres not a bad performance in the house, albeit most feel smaller., J-Lo is the only reason to see it., Its meant as a compliment when strong females are called ballsy, but it would be truer to say that J-Los extraordinary creation is vagina-y., Hustlers is a classically made film about capital - sexual, social and financial., A lean, fierce take on the nature of female empowerment in an inherently corrupted world., This is a deeply feminist film, one where men are given less screen time than the cameoing Cardi B and Lizzo."
Angel Has Fallen,0,"Gerard Butler takes viewers on a thrill ride as he fights for his reputation and his life., As an action-thriller with political intrigue, this movie does its job. Its Nolte who at times lifts it to another level., Angel Has Fallen is a film in search of a soul. It doesnt find it, but the effort is appreciated., Efficient B-movie trash that I enjoyed watching...I enjoyed myself, and I really hadnt expected to., Its a throwback piece of entertainment, but in the way it evaporates as soon as it ends, its also a throwaway. By the time its over, its already fallen from your memory., The franchise has fallen and it cant get up., Faults, flaws and all this supposedly final chapter in the adventures of Mike Banning got the job done as far as I was concerned., There is something odd about the way the film condemns bloodshed while revelling in trigger-happy violence., The phrase Never bring a knife to a gunfight is radically undermined by a sequence that goes from machine gun fight, to pistol duel, to knife fight, to fisticuffs, to homoerotic frenemy moment., The unimaginative script matches the uninspired action scenes, which are worsened by shabby computer graphics. The laziness of this franchise is apparent in the third part..., The film seems to have cobbled its set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection., The product of a vague and unconvincing plot, the violence here is simply and purely awful., Director Ric Roman Waughs staging of the intense scenes of conflict and action is assured and exciting., Angel Has Fallen feels like it was cobbled together with cliched action scenes and circumstances overused by the once-popular TV series 24., Theres no thrill to this thriller. Nor is there nuance to the characters., If this type of no-brow entertainment is your thing, you may find something to like in Angel Has Fallen but that doesnt mean you need what these guys are reselling., Angel Has Fallen plays out exactly as you would expect from a potboiler of this type. No surprises here, other than that it exists at all., It might still be passable for cable, but this series has sadly fallen into unwatchable territory., The Fugitive, to which Angel owes perhaps even its rooftop finale, is a template against which this movie inevitably falls short., Butler can do more, but hes so good at doing this one thing that it has become his brand. That might be a blessing or a curse, but if its a curse, there are worse curses."
Darlin' ,0,"Taking a harrowing Jack Ketchum adaptation and injecting humor into it is a challenge, one that McIntosh isnt quite equipped to handle in this wildly uneven film., Polly McIntosh does indeed have what it takes to one day make a solidly entertaining and dramatically satisfying film, even if she hasnt quite done that here., Darlin\  may not be as stomach-turning as The Woman... but McIntosh understands the strength of this strange series, which is all about how humanity is inherently savage and clannish, no matter how well-groomed and well-mannered we may seem., Its content grows so tonally awry that by the end, youre not sure to what extent McIntosh is serious or joking - nor is there much indication that she knows, either., A film that ultimately feels static and unresolved., An imperfect movie, but I admire McIntoshs go-for-broke style and the ambition of this project, one that reminded me of George A. Romero in the way it tries to blend social commentary, pitch-black humor, and a heavy dose of bloody make-up."
Wonder Park,0,"This writer would like to thank the young gentleman who vigorously kicked the back of her chair during the family preview screening, thereby keeping her awake., You and your children will have sat through many worse films that took far easier routes to the screen - which is not to say that Wonder Park is not immediately forgettable., Kind of a poor mans Inside Out or Up, the story fails to earn its emotional stripes and instead goes haywire with non-stop hecticness involving barely sketched characters., Its hard to dismiss Wonder Park out of hand. Its a film for tots thats asking genuinely huge questions, mostly about the nature of play as an act of denial...And for that alone its worthy of attention and respect., It aspires to be Inside Out but falls way short., Wonder Park feels like a tribute act from every angle, but there are worse things childrens films can do than openly mimic the greats., A few hectic chase scenes aside, children will likely find the film both boring and upsetting, a deadly combination., Wonder Park has a splendiferous story to tell. If only all the pages were there., Wonder Park hammers home feelings of abandonment to underline a message about creativity that didnt need such emotionally downbeat elements to have resonance., Its all so hyperactively paced and so frenetically animated I cant say the film as a whole left me satisfied., To put it simply, Wonder Park can\t keep the wonder and the park on the same page., Melancholy in all the wrong ways, this is a mostly forgettable movie that only makes a strong impression when its disturbing or saddening in a manner the film itself seem only dimly aware of., The wonders of Wonder Park are dampened by the pall of grief that the protagonist is experiencing, while the wacky amusement park antics prevent the story from going especially deep., The character design is bland...bit the Wonderland is indeed wonderful and the message of imagination as a sustaining source of comfort is wonderful as well., If Wonder Park were a carnival attraction, it would be the merry-go-round. The animated movie has animals, relentless positivity and the most predictable journey ever., A clumsy but amiable kids movie with a streak of sincerity that stretches further than the Wonder Park itself., But even before it gets to its conspicuously director-less end credits, Wonder Park has the unmistakable air of a promising movie no one has taken full responsibility for polishing into a good one., Wonder Park feels like the kind of mild attraction that younger kids might enjoy when it hits secondary platforms. Its just not an adventure thats worth the price of a ticket or standing in line to see., Wonder Park brings a welcomed depth to its base plot of a girl creating roller coasters. While the premise that reads like a generic fantasy-adventure-comedy for kids, the film manages to intelligently traverse a wide range of emotions., Wonder Park has a great premise about a spunky kid engineer and a world she constructs taking flight, but takes a few too many dark loop-de-loops and crashes hard. If you pass this amusement park, skip it."
Charlie's Angels ,0,"In 2019, Charlies Angels is less about impossibly perfect women saving the world and more about women joining forces to save the world. Its the direct opposite of the lens used by the men of the film..., But this is a rare multiplex movie that rewards patience, with the action and the goofiness ramping up in the second hour., Is hard to feel too grumpy when everyone involved looks like theyre having so much fun... But Elizabeth Banks demonstrates a shaky grasp of pacing, which frequently makes it feel draggier than it should., Charlies Angels tries earnestly to bring these ladies into the 21st century. And it might have worked, if the film didnt so consistently pull its punches., I really, really enjoyed it., But while this girl-power action flick happily bashes you over the head with its feminist credentials, elsewhere it keeps missing the mark., Even pulpy chicksploitation franchises can evolve to reflect the zeitgeist, it seems., If its a crime to enjoy Stewart, in a fluorescent pink jockey ensemble, hopping on a horse to chase some chauvinist dinosaurs down, cuff me this second., From the very first, this Charlies Angels is all about action and pointless international location work, without the necessary lightness and the solvent of fun., Rarely can a movie have left the editing room with so many scenes simply petering out, as if the punchlines had been left on the back seat of an Uber., The film nobody asked for turns out to be the film nobody deserves., A passable, if a little predictable, addition to a tired old franchise., Girl-power franchise Charlies Angels gets a fun but slightly forgettable update., Rather than having a story, the film has a string of rote action sequences, and each of these sequences goes the same way., Banks gets the soundtrack right, and the costumes and hairstyles are impressive. But the action set-pieces are not, and the story itself is a weak spy thriller with a collection of caricatured men..., Charlies Angels should have been glamorous fun, a Saturday-night-out kind of movie. Suddenly, staying in with an icepack on your head never looked so good., More discouraging than the fact that it got remade is the fact that the storys moral hasnt changed one bit since Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu were the ones telling it. At least that movie had a catchy song by Destinys Child., Overall, it hits all the right buttons for its genre and for the Charlies Angels canon in general while still standing on its own and playing to the strengths of its three stars., Miss Stewart is just wonderful... Shes just fantastic., The film emerges as a perfectly agreeable action movie, one thats both true to the concept of Charlies Angels, and probably unrecognizable to anyone time-traveling from the 1970s. Thats okay, though. Some concepts have to evolve to survive."
Just Mercy,0,"Foxx does his best work in a decade. For the charismatic Jordan, who puts in a tone-setting nuanced turn here, Just Mercy arrives between Creed II and Tom Clancy\s Without Remorse. Let\s hope he sticks with the one for them, one for me formula., Just Mercy is solid, meat-and-potatoes docudrama filmmaking, if you don\t mind a first-rate story of systemic injustice undercut by second-rate dialogue., Unlike many movies based on a true story, Just Mercy sticks close to the facts of the case - for the simple reason that the facts are drama enough., Its both rage-inducing and awe-inspiring; the courage conveyed by the protagonists is a balm on the sting of injustice., Its competently made... Thought has been put into this production, and again, Im completely a hundred percent on the side of everything it has to say. I just dont think its a very good movie., Just Mercy is a deeply moving film, a human story about injustice and justice and how intangible and ephemeral they both really are., an earnest and important film about the still-festering sore of race in todays America - though when pitted against inveterate, sneering prejudice, its protagonists one-note saintliness, however real, does not make for the most compelling drama, Its steady and clear-headed, safe in the knowledge that truth is the ultimate humaniser., Just Mercy isnt interested in giving it a showy new spin. Instead the extraordinary, hope-inspiring true story is allowed to speak for itself, powered along by committed turns by Jordan and Brie Larson., It\s good acting at its finest in this preaching to the choir right to life drama that might have worked had the filmmakers chosen to show the audience a little mercy by not constantly talking down to them., Jordan, however, is completely persuasive. The virtues possessed by Stevenson are all on the quiet side. His analytical flair is matched by his patience, his tenacity and his acuity., Still, by the time you reach the end - and realise how closely the film-makers have stuck to the facts - you wont care. That the truth will out is entertainment enough., Just Mercy isnt stylistically dazzling. The chronicle of racism is also familiar. But Cretton and his leads give the narrative an urgency and timeliness., In parts stolid, but solid nevertheless, Just Mercy is timely and important., This is a powerful drama about an important ongoing issue., The film has this kind of slow burn quality, it has a very good ensemble cast., Its never less than engrossing. Even with the schmaltz., Jordan... has steel and energy in his part, and... Foxx... gives a beautifully modulated, unflashy and quietly moving performance, easily his best in at least a decade., The markers of the story are so familiar (venal law enforcement, leaned-on witnesses, the courtroom), it takes nerve to tell it this simply., The films power lies in the brutality of its true story, and yet that narrative stays within fairly conventional bounds precisely because of Crettons commitment to telling it."
Blinded by the Light ,0,"Most of the films emotional weight is undermined by cheesy sing-alongs with the lyrics visualized in such a garish way that the supposed thematic significance bashes the audience in the head., The film feels authentic in its depiction both of Javeds family but also the changes that took place after what seems to have been akin to a religious conversion., The deliberately amateurish style of the musical numbers is supposed to engender spontaneity but too often looks merely cack-handed. Nonetheless, you come out on a high. Springsteen fever proves to be contagious., While its far from perfect, on balance, its an inoffensive, feel-good and inspirational British dramedy with some charming performances and an emotionally affecting story about an immigrant teenager and how he finds salvation in Springsteens music., Much of the film plays out in a predictable, if charming, way., Despite its predictability, it conveys what its like to be enraptured by a rock idol., If youre seeking a cutesy movie with some recognizable songs, this will do., It is almost as if the movies more noticeable imperfections only end up making the feature as a whole even more infectiously intoxicating., Even when it feels as if weve seen this movie before, weve never seen it set to the sounds of the Boss, and weve never seen it from the point of view of this particular terrific kid and his family., Blinded by the Light represents such a sweet, easy-to-relate-to story that it deserves to be seen, at the least, by anyone who has shown a little faith that there\s magic in the arts -- either in music, or a darkened theater., Watching the teenage Javed become his own man is the best time Ive had at the movies this year., Blinded by the Light at its very best, captures the experience of being a fan, the pure exhilaration of it, and the sense of your vision opening out to vistas beyond your horizon., As in Bend it Like Beckham, Chadha\s gift for kinetic storytelling reflects the turbulent emotion of the young protagonists., Its a dream of inclusion that feels narrow, a vision of liberation that feels constrained, a view of progress that feels like a lockstep into the future., Nobody wins unless everybody wins, Springsteen likes to say. This little movie is a big winner., A lesser film would have put more focus on Bruce himself, but Chadha wisely makes Blinded by the Light Javed\s story., While nothing that happens is surprising, nearly all of it is performed with soulfulness and conviction and charm., Its far from subtle, more than a little sudsy, but also pleasingly direct and full of heart., These songs have the power to move, inspire, make you dance. For the first time in my experience of Springsteen, they made me want to hide under my seat., Joyous and funny even as it strikes the occasional melancholy chord, Blinded by the Light is a testament to the small miracle of how the right music manages to find us at just the right time..."
Hubie Halloween,0,"Sandler has done some brilliant dramatic work over the years, so its a pity he persists in churning out such garbage-level comedy. But if Netflix keeps chucking millions at you, what are you going to do?, Sandler surely knew this mildly offensive, juvenile celebration of cheap scares, slapstick gags and bodily function jokes was sure to land near the bottom of the large pile of terrible movies starring himself., More unexpectedly, its generally bearable - a light, sweet and nostalgic comedy that is pleasantly devoid of high stakes., Sandler has always been a repository of goofy voices, but what he thought was funny about the mannered muttering he does here is unclear., Hubie Halloween is a seasonal goodie, and it\s more treat than trick., None of this is particularly original, but nobody said you had to be original to make people laugh., The concept of combining Adam Sandler and horror is not a bad one. But this is no Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein. Instead, Hubie Halloween inspires mild dread for all the wrong reasons., Sandlers laugh-free special will land in your living room like a flaming paper bag., The jokes aren\t often Sandler\s best material but Hubie Halloween is as sweet and easily digestible as a Milky Way., There is something half-satisfying and pacifying about Hubie Halloween., Just generally entertaining enough to be harmless, while also being the kind of movie that people will have trouble remembering exists by the time he makes Tommy Thanksgiving., It isnt especially quick or funny even by the comedians basic standards - but is also too cheerfully, indifferently silly to raise much ire., If youre not already a Sandler fan youll probably quickly tire of his antics, but for the fans Hubie Halloween is another slice of affectionate silliness..., Those choosing to stay at home instead of trick-or-treating during this year of unfunny horrors could do much worse than this., Hubie Halloween is not Sandler\s prophesied film apocalypse. In fact, it\s one of the guy\s better straight-up comedies in quite a few years., Hardcore Sandman fans will find plenty to adore in Hubie, which is akin to a mini Baby Ruth candy bar in a trick-or-treat bag: sweet, gooey, nutty and satisfying enough., Exactly what you\d expect from the descriptor Adam Sandler Netflix movie, with a little extra heart to distinguish it from the other movies in Sandler\s uneven Netflix run."
Onward ,0,"Theres a lot to like in Onward, the least of which is its bright, appealing animation, character design and world building, but you wouldnt expect anything less from an outfit as accomplished as Pixar., A very sweet story, good but not great...kids will love it., The second half pulled it together. By the end of it, I was like, well done., Onward feels a bit more subdued than a typical Pixar affair, and while the movie wears its heart on its sleeve, it might not be quite as engaging for younger viewers., Do families need fathers? Scanlon delivers a love song to atypical clans, which couldnt end on a sweeter, or clearer, note., The fractious bond between the brothers and their aching anger at the loss of a parent are evoked with exquisite sorrow and clarity., Scanlons film is an improvement on his previous directorial effort, the pointless prequel Monsters University. But Onward falls well short of magical., Even mid-level Pixar still casts a spell., While it isnt as emotionally involving as some other Pixar films, there is sufficient artistry and joyful storytelling here, There\s something here for everyone, even if the overall package isn\t likely to go down as the next Disney/Pixar classic., Onwardmanages to find a balance between comedy and adventure that\s eminently satisfying. The magic ingredient that drives this movie is sincerity., Onward feels frantically eager to please, until it tries to yank at your heartstrings in the by-now familiar formula of Pixar Animation., The adventure and world building in Onward are utterly delightful with an especially effective balance of playfulness and depth., A likable family comedy that finds an easy rhythm without effort., Its a pretty gosh darn imaginative place, and its a safe bet kids of all shapes and sizes will look at it all in wide-eyed glee., A testament to the remarkable degree of emotional expressiveness that Pixars character-animators can imbue into a story., Only a true cynic could wholly resist Onwards deeper themes, but they come in the service of a movie that has to be classified in the mid-level tier of the Pixar file., Its enjoyable enough if you dont mind machine-made entertainment, but so desperate to please that it wears out its welcome long before the closing credits., As a Pixar entry, it may be the first to explicitly grapple with not the trials of childhood, but the fraught onset of adulthood. By the time Onward has wrapped its journey, it will probably be the only movie with a manticore to make you cry., It may not be as revolutionary as some of Pixars past offerings - and in that sense, it offers a glimpse of the studios likely future - but it still retains a spark of that old-time magic."
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,0,"Unfortunately, the film didnt feel like it really had a story. It felt like a series of sketches, and most of them werent very funny., Though not as joltingly outrageous as its predecessors, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge On The Run is a winsomely wacky good time, alive with laughs and light-hearted lunacy., There\s nothing stiff or self-serious about Sponge on the Run, which plays equally to young children and college stoners alike., Sweet, silly, with that profoundly bizarre world view that makes a snail trail gag open to everyone for a laugh, this may not change SpongeBob forever, but its more SpongeBob as we love him, and thats all the fun you can need., Watching one of these movies is like having a vision of Cthulhu; you walk away from the experience a changed person, possibly raving about the apocalypse., The movie is an act of loony generosity we shouldnt refuse. This is ludicrous entertainment for frazzled times., Resistance is futile. SpongeBob is going to win you over. So settle back to enjoy the ebullient silliness, sweet friendship, origin story, very surprising guest stars., The pacing lags, the goofiness sags, and you discover over time that theres not much holding these antics together., Sponge on the Run may take us back under the sea, but this sponge is all dried up., Its mindless fun, just what the doctor ordered., This trip is filled with goofy fun, though it wanders enough to occasionally test the attention spans of those neither young enough nor high enough to be in the films target audience., But I will say that SpongeBob is what we need all the time. The more the merrier., Sponge on the Run milks the actor\s brand for a number of solid laughs), and the animation is detailed and inventive enough for the whole film to feel drenched in SpongeBob\s demented energy., Sponge on the Run is very much a members-only affair. Then again, three movies and several hundred TV episodes into a 22-year-old franchise, it\s not unreasonable to think the audience for this adventure is pretty well baked into the cake., The intentions of Sponge On The Runs writer-director, Tim Hill... might be noble. But the result mostly serves as a reminder that SpongeBob SquarePants, despite all the fun, is a lucrative modern media franchise like any other., In an era when so many eight-minute animated shorts have been bloated beyond proportion when becoming 90-minute movies, Team SpongeBob deserves credit for building out a storyline without losing sight of what made the original beloved in the first place., If the SpongeBob franchise has finally gone on the run, it seems like its left the audience that matters most in the dust., Its a simple plot, but the movie vaults over the humdrum wheel-spinning quality that has come to define too much studio animation., Fast, funny, demented., I\m so confused, said my 10-year-old, reacting to the movie\s strange distractions and delights while barely hanging onto the throwaway plot."
Freaky ,0,"Keyed into its worldview and has fun with it in clever ways. It walks the line so so delicately, I was happily taken aback by this one., The film has its moments, but a camp Vince Vaughn is a device of diminishing returns., Freaky zips by amusingly enough, but its concepts never quite pop like they did in Happy Death Day, nor does it push the envelope enough for a film that references the dark masterpiece that is Heathers so early on., Freaky isnt half as odd as it could be, and its less satisfying as a result., When its in the mood, horror can be a sexually subversive genre; it can also be a flagrantly non-PC one. Freaky treads a treacherous line between the two with aplomb., While not quite on a par with Happy Death Day, Freaky is an ebullient slasher that strikes a perfect balance of comedy and carnage., Freaky knows its a farce and winks at the silliest of slasher tropes, but that satirical edge doesnt keep it from being one of the most purely enjoyable horror works Ive seen in a long time., You can feel the humor and the terror continually goosing each other here instead of canceling each other, even in the bits that dont quite work or feel like padding., Freaky isnt just the future of inclusive, social justice horror either. Freaky is the future of the horror genre altogether., A freak flag half-flown., Simply put, Freaky sucks., Things lag in the flabby midsection and a tacked-on double ending would have been better left on the cutting room floor, but Freaky has enough going for it - namely Vaughn, who\s better than he\s been able to be in years - that it\s worth a stab., Its fun to watch Kathryn Newton and Vince Vaughn play each other, but I think it runs out of steam as it goes on., Vince Vaughn is convincing as both a serial killer and the teen who inhabits his person in the self-aware horror comedy., Freaky is amusing and gory enough to still be an entertaining slasher movie with its own satisfying spin on the final-girl trope., Not every joke or jolt hits the mark. But thanks to a go-for-broke Vince Vaughn as a serial killer who body swaps with a teen girl, you wont find d a better way to laugh out loud while being scared senseless than with this Freaky Friday the 13th., Blumhouse has an uncanny ability to identify projects that sound compelling on paper but are less attractive when watched on-screen. Freaky is the latest of these., In between all of the murders and mayhem, there is room for some sly humor and some genuine warmth. Vaughn and Newton have a blast and it is a lot of fun., We can\t argue Freaky takes the genre to the next level, exactly - but it\s still bloody good fun., No one is doing comedy-horror better. As with the Happy Death Day films, Freaky hilariously modernizes the high school bloodbath for laughs."
Tenet ,0,"Nolan prioritizes the dense audiovisual spectacle of his most narratively complex films. Beyond the intellectual, they exist primarily, and more accessibly, as experiences. Put another way: Tenet is a vibe., As a delivery system for the thrills, I think the film gets a long way, and you can kind of sit back and enjoy it. As a delivery system for the ideas, I think it trips itself up an awful lot., Something like the epitome of Nolans temporally twisty canon, distilling his many cinematic signatures and preoccupations down to their entrancing abstract essence., Christopher Nolan is very clever, but mostly irritating is what I find. His movies are not cerebral - theyre fake cerebral... He doesnt even do the time travel right., I am a big fan of Christopher Nolans films -- I usually enjoy the time puzzle of it -- but this seems even more intentionally inaccessible and challenging than everything else... Confusing, distancing, and chilly., Tenet is indeed impressive, although I gave up trying to follow the plot., Tenet is difficult to understand, but even worse, it inspires little desire to understand it., The auteur doesnt show much growth in his most recent self-indulgent work., It is easy to sit back and revel in the wonder of the big-screen experience, and to immediately want to see the film again. And again., For a writer often accused of being humorless, this may be his most playful script, often arid in its dry humor, and much of it provided by Pattinson playing an inverted Felix Leiter to Washingtons stoical Bond riff., Tenet is what happens when Nolan forgets Bordens wisdom from The Prestige. Hes so obsessed with how impressive his secret is that the trick he uses it for is nothing., What strikes you is how determinedly bare of feeling it seems, even when emotional opportunities present themselves., Telling a story backward sounds bizarre - it is bizarre - but it works. The backward stuff in Tenet sounds bizarre - worse than bizarre, goofy - and for a while it works. But once it doesn\t, it really doesn\t., Its the first Nolan movie in a long while that Ive left feeling disappointed. And yet there is enough good stuff buried beneath its antiseptic, perhaps overly showy technique, once you get past the clankier bits, that is worth exploring., Its a shiny clockwork contraption with a hollow center: a convoluted Rubiks Cube blockbuster that, once solved, reveals little more than the complexity of its own design., John David Washington has crossed a bridge. Hes no longer just the son of a superstar actor. He is a superstar actor., Both utterly dazzling and increasingly bewildering., Maybe you could follow what is happening if you wrote it all down on a flow chart with circles and arrows and multiple colored inks, but it wouldnt be worth the effort - and thats hard to do in a dark movie theater., These amazing set pieces, while respectable for their reliance on practical effects and impressive for Nolans commitment to his craft, often feel divorced from the rest of Tenet., Nolan has finally zoomed out so far with a story that fundamentals of physics have themselves become character motivations."
The United States vs. Billie Holiday,0,"Andra Day outclasses and saves an otherwise humdrum movie., Andra Day is spellbindingly good as the jazz legend whose anti-racist song Strange Fruit made her an enemy of the racist U.S. government, but the film built around her isn\t worthy., Day is simply dazzling in the role, and more than makes up for some of the films other shortcomings, which include the rather ponderous direction., Lee Daniels new movie is the first clear-eyed look at her life that weve seen on screen. And this time, theres plenty of grit with the glamour., Lady Day\s pain and incomparable talent feel authentic, thanks solely to Andra Day. Everything around her feels so shamefully inauthentic that it dishonors both., Andra Day is amazing, and she is far and away the best part of this movie., It all hangs on Andra Days performance. Shes fantastic in this movie., I think overall there were some moving moments, but the execution kind of left something to be desired... I always judge a film by whether or not Id watch again - and for me? Once was enough., It feels like Im watching trauma porn with one hell of a soundtrack., The biggest flaw of The United States vs. Billie Holiday, besides its commitment to substituting shocking violence for character development, is that it cannot decide how its leading lady sees herself., Its a film that punishes its main character and, rather than watching her live (forget celebrating her life in its wholeness), waits - perhaps almost hopes - for her to finally die, having finally endured too much., The United States vs. Billie Holiday isn\t quite worthy of the performance at its core., The central performance is brilliant. Stylistically, its very all over the place and it swerves between hallucinogenic sequences and bodacious music...that muddies the whole...worth seeing for the performance., There is a story about Billie Holiday that we really need to see...but this is not it. I struggle with this, because I love Lee Daniels..., Maybe each era invents the Lady Day that suits it. Lee Danielss new drama, The United States vs. Billie Holiday, sweeps in as a valiant corrective, starring the singer Andra Day as a complicated, impulsive, vibrant person..., Billie Holiday -- Andra Day\s impressive and unexpected lo-fi approach to the role notwithstanding -- is missing. Billie Holiday, a brutally thin sketch of the woman, is all the movie is prepared to give us., The more you know about legendary singer Billie Holiday the more trouble youre likely to have digesting Lee Danielss punishing new biopic. The film fails to express how much music meant to her-or what an impact she made on audiences & fellow musicians, Respect the ambition, but just doesnt quite land., This is Days show all the way, and her performance remains the films strongest suit., Billie Holidays life was filled with so much tragedy and triumph that it must count as some sort of accomplishment to make a boring movie about her."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,0,"For fans of cinematic spectacle, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings offers some of the best choreographed action sequences of the Marvel Cinematic Universe., The first half of the film is better, and I liked it much more than I was expecting., Its a strong debut for a new hero, injecting diverse blood into the MCU in a way that does not feel forced or hollow. I just think the overall film is still less than the sum of its more outstanding parts., Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings at least continues the studios track record of enlisting the talents of truly great artists. Here, that would be the commanding and charismatic Leung., Great action, Simu Liu is a great kind of charismatic center for the film., The picture rattles along with an unpretentious vigour too rare in the Marvel universe., Its a good movie. Its got a plausibly fearsome villain by way of Leung, a nice ensemble of heroic personalities, and a dose of actually-poignant family drama undergirding all the rest., A metatextual antithesis to the racism and whitewashing in Marvels own history, and a cinematic celebration of the Chinese diaspora on and off screen., Its vanishingly rare for a film to actually deserve its hype. But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does so, and more., Shang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is a strong step forward for the MCU., Almost any movie ascending out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point requires a classicists devotion to subtextual minutiae. Which is exactly why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is such a breath of freshly fantastical air., So what if the showoff climax subs depth for dazzle. As the first Asian hero in Marvel history, former stuntman Simu Liu is action poetry in motion and his epic starring debut kicks off the fall film season on a rousing high note., Shang-Chi and Katy are my new best friends., Shang-Chi doesnt just pull off a fun western xuanhuan, but makes it feel like a door being opened for future Marvel films., Yes, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is culturally significant, but this should not be lost: It\s also a fantastic movie., Its fresh, its alive, its not the same old Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are also awesome dragons., Shang-Chi holds his own, but he doesn\t leave you wanting more. It feels like a one-and-done while we get back to the main attraction., As the MCU emerges from the long shadow of the Infinity Saga, the newest members of the ever-growing ensemble make a compelling case for belonging among the candidates for the next iteration of The Avengers., A refreshing romp through - and loving homage to - martial arts cinema., Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, the film is somewhat overstuffed and lumpy in parts and the last surreal third is poorly knitted into the rest of the narrative, but its all impossible to predict and youll leave the theater satisfied."
The Many Saints of Newark,0,"Alessandro Nivola is brilliant as Tony’s uncle, Dickie Moltisanti, an unstable explosive who didn’t feature in The Sopranos but whose story provides fascinating insights into characters such as Tony’s mother, Lydia (Vera Farmiga). Expect laughs too., No doubt devotees of the series will have different opinions as to the value of this backstory, but seen in isolation, as an intense and sometimes violent story of a dysfunctional family, the film is richly rewarding in its own right., Newcomers to the Soprano saga will have no difficulty tuning in. The narrative soon begins to take on the classic lines of authentic tragedy., The movie was, to borrow an image from the Pine Barrens episode, like sucking ketchup packets., I walked out of the theatre wishing for a limited TV series rather than a movie. Although The Many Saints of Newark offers an alluring glimpse into Tony Sopranos birth under a bad sign, it never shows the blue moon in the mobsters eyes., All of this is done well enough (although the late 60s and early 70s costuming feels a bit exaggerated, too on the nose) but its certainly not enough to elevate this film to the level of The Sopranos., As becomes almost immediately clear, there was no real reason for the movie to have been made, no inspiration for it that was not commercial., As a Goodfellas-ish crime drama that vividly evokes time and place, Saints is rendered with enough bare-knuckled verve, unpredictability, and darkly glinting wit to make it work., This is something the fans of the Sopranos have been wanting, and as a fan myself of the series, I found it fascinating to see Gandolfinis son playing with subtle distinctions as an interesting performer..., Even a seasoned Sopranos viewer will never feel completely sure of where the story is going., I like a lot about it, but it also feels like David Chase is trying to get an entire season of television into this two hour film., Its a polished, entertaining film, but a lot of its meaning derives from how much the audience cares about a handful of TV characters they may or may not already know., Heaven for Sopranos fans, though this is really less a prequel than a spin-off., Its a very smart piece of work that, oddly, owes as much to the films of Martin Scorsese as to the world Chase built over six appalling, satisfying seasons., Reduces characters of potentially mythic power to a handful of defining traits and pins them to a diorama-like backdrop of historical readymades., Even the pleasurable sight of Michael Gandolfini as young Tony was never going to make up for the complete absence, in this film, of anything remotely reflective of the tone and color of The Sopranos., Go ahead, arrange a sitdown: This darkly funny and ultra-violent film perfectly depicts the 1960s times and voices that shaped Tony into a made man., The magnetic Nivolas Uncle Dickie pulls the movies focus and overwhelms the coming-of-age saga that brought the gang -- and its many fans -- together in the first place., Making bigger than life gangster feature films is an art that should be left to the pros (Scorsese, Coppola). Stepping out of its cable TV lane hasnt helped The Many Saints of Newark., The creeping darkness of Many Saints of Newark has an effective build, an unnerving, pathetic portrait of past rot that would really only shift in clothing choices and locations to become the present tense of The Sopranos."
Wish Dragon,0,"I feel so indifferent about this whole thing... I forgot it as soon as I saw it., Wish Dragon delivers a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view, and that\s plenty., Wish Dragon is a transporting experience, but it\s far from a whole new world., Though Din\s relationship with Long never reaches the level of pathos Disney conjured with Aladdin and the Genie, Wish Dragon manages to offer a different riff on the classic be true to yourself narrative."
Crisis ,0,"Jarecki doesnt pretend to offer solutions, but his film does reveal how lost we can all get in the mix., I enjoyed Crisis. The performances are first rate and the tension builds throughout to a climax and then an aftermath., Its a union of crime and politics of the kind that you might expect to find on one of the streaming services, but its given extra heft by its broad canvas and ambitious segues., For all of its good intentions, the generic Crisis isnt showing us anything new., Those who have died or spent years tackling the opioid crisis deserve better than this., The films narrative and characters reason that any difficult situation can be solved with blind brute force and a pistol. If youre looking for a cutting critique of the American addiction industry, look elsewhere., Its a little too all over the place, with a few too many movies trying to be contained in this to be able to come together and make sense., It\s a noble effort, but like plans for a quick trip across the river to Montreal, Crisis never comes together., Its not enough merely to tell stories about different aspects of how drugs impact society - the connections have to be stronger and the narratives have to go deeper that what Jarecki has provided here., Its biggest crisis is that its a thriller with no thrills., The film juggles three main stories and more minor ones, and several end up going over the top..., Crisis feels like a lecture made up entirely of hypotheticals., The tragedy associated with such stories could provide fertile territory, theoretically, for a good drama about what went wrong and whos ultimately responsible. That movie might get made someday, but Crisis isnt it., A classic example of a movie that wants to be a little bit of everything, only to add up to a much lesser version of something you keep waiting to see., Nicholas Jarecki who wrote, directed, produced, and also appears in a supporting role, does none of these things well. Especially all of them.... Crisis is meant to be hard-hitting, but it is completely soft-headed., The issues - from addiction itself to the flawed incentives at institutions that might prevent it - demand a more expansive treatment., Filmmaker Nicholas Jarecki deploys a multi-narrative structure, a la Steven Soderbergh\s Traffic, for his well-intended epic on the American opioid epidemic. It doesn\t work., It feels like research dressed as a drama., Crisis is something of a horror film, and not in a good way., Well-meaning but underwhelming."
Playing God ,0,"What doesnt work on a logic level makes sense according to the characters and performances. And the twists - a con movie always has twists - are quite satisfying, even if you see them coming., Playing God is this weeks episode of Good Actors, Less Than Ideal Script."
Without Remorse ,0,"The good news is that Without Remorse is pretty great when it comes to the action, and there is a lot of it., It made me think, I should just be playing the video game...boring, boring, boring., While its no Hunt for Red October, this stripped-down, unapologetically retro thriller still gets the job done., The film doesnt reinvent the wheel when it comes to action thrillers. But where it does succeed is presenting a character that is entirely different from either Harrison Fords or John Krasinskis Jack Ryan, which exist in the same Tom Clancy Universe., Without Remorse is sleek, formulaic spectacle anchored by a charismatic, durable hero., Amid a multitude of sins committed by the aggressively unimpactful Without Remorse, underusing Colman Domingo might be the most unforgivable., The charismatic leading man Jordan isnt at his best in by-the-book spy thriller..., I didnt know Michael B. Jordan could be charmless or so boring., Its an experience much like watching someone play Call of Duty for 110 minutes straight - action-packed, maybe, but oh so dreary., Without Remorse is a convoluted thriller thats far too scenically modest for its supposedly wide canvas, and way too shortsighted to maximize its Black lead character., With his outrageously articulated physique and an unsmiling visage featuring faraway eyes conveying both determination and recently experienced loss, Jordan is more than up to the task., No knock on serving up an action-jacked Michael B.Jordan in an R-rated, red-meat, military thriller. But this clumsy update of Clancys 1993 bestseller should have been way better than a generic, one-note, cash grab, Something to kill 100 minutes or so while youre avoiding something else, delivered in an impersonal but not unskillful manner., I wish the movie broke as many rules as its characters., Sollima knows how to film violence, so individual moments stand out. What Sollima cant do is make a good movie from a bad script., For something based on a Clancy novel, its disappointingly lacking in the authors trademark complexity and detail. This is pure disposable entertainment - nothing more, nothing less., The action is sharp and imaginative, and Jordan strongly establishes his action-flick credentials. But story-wise its all very familiar and more than a little dour., It takes itself more seriously than it should, but you can take it with as much seriousness as you like. Personally, I advise little to none., Jordan makes a sturdy enough action hero, but the character as portrayed doesnt give him any contours to play., It still feels like a made-for-television movie, a Friday night time passer whose characters, dialogue and plot all feel purely stock."
After We Fell,0,"They seem to be caught in a loop composed of a never-ending series of quarrels reliably followed by make-up sex shot in languorous close-up and accompanied by anodyne pop., Though After We Fell aims for the scintillating eroticism of a lithe young couple risking getting caught with some semi-public hot tub sex, the whole experience is more akin to taking a lukewarm bath in a swimsuit., Should come with a warning to viewers: contains extremely boring sex."
Funny Pages ,0,"Funny Pages understands that being truly committed to comics, the lowest form in all the arts (except for performance poetry, of course), is an express ticket to a life of social misery and alienation., What an auspicious debut for Kline and what a fine showcase for all other parties., Zolghadri carries the film with the kind of self assured nonchalance rarely seen on screen. His character’s wide-eyed optimism, although clearly misguided, is both infectious and genuinely awe-inspiring., Whilst there’s not much emotion to cling on to, the parade of uniquely absurd characters and agonising situations make it a real page turner., Zolghadri, a newcomer, is a natural lead, and boasts an easygoing, Fred Savage from The Wonder Years energy, but Kline, from behind the camera, is the movie’s real star. , The movie is set in the present but has the bleachy look and antic energy of a lost American burlesque by Hal Ashby or Elaine May, time capsuled in 1974. , Kline’s script wisely doesn’t pick a side, but like an underground graphic novel, simply rejoices in the grot. Fun seldom feels less good or clean than this., ... More authentic and more absurd than anything to come before it. , Big fistfuls of awkward drama and discomfort define this movie. Kline relishes the pleasurable grossness, dwelling in comedic scenes that end well beyond their punchlines., Funny Pages still feels slight and only vaguely shaped. Well-observed details are great, but they’ll only take you so far., It is gross, but in a very tactile, visceral way... It feels very raw and alive. , Such a bracing example of a singular, and distinctive, new voice, that one can’t help but love it, grody toenails and all. , Funny Pages has a startlingly anti-inspirational attitude, while still being wrapped in the trappings of an inspirational movie., The writing and direction by Owen Kline is deadpan slack., Funny Pages is a canny portrayal of a young man from a comfortable background going on a sojourn amid the outcasts, failures, and economically desperate, but you get a sense, by the end of the film, of Kline playing tourist himself., “Funny Pages”... sometimes feels like an exercise in misplaced artistry, a student’s overly precocious stab at brutish cynicism., Funny Pages would program well alongside Crumb or American Splendor, spiritually connected films about difficult personalities that weren\t afraid to get a little dirty themselves. , The young director Owen Kline packs worlds of cringe into “Funny Pages” — shame, disgust, embarrassment, sweaty sexual panic, acres of pustules — it’s all here in this terrific, tonally flawless feature debut., Its all deliberately grotesque, but comic readers will be pleasantly surprised at the degree of compassion for and comprehension of the culture Kline portrays. , “Funny Pages” does many things right, many of those things mixing pain and misery with the humor of pain and the punchlines of misery."
My Best Friend's Exorcism ,0,"here are flashes of a much better movie throughout My Best Friend’s Exorcism, but the one we get just isn’t self-possessed enough to hold onto them for long., The film repeatedly undercuts whatever tension is mustered with its frustrating tendency to crack goofy, juvenile jokes., My Best Friend’s Exorcism could perhaps do with one or two genuine scares. But for anyone old enough to remember Tiffany and advice columns in teenage girls’ magazines, this is going to deliver a pleasing shot of nostalgia., The straightforward possession story struggles to overcome its low stakes and rushed narrative., My Best Friend’s Exorcism, in spite of its more discordant eccentricities, adds modest thrills to a spooky season watchlist., The wildly inconsistent tones in the horror-comedy “My Best Friend’s Exorcism” keep threatening to derail the movie, though the cast and the story ultimately save the picture., With very little interest conjured from the filmmakers to properly develop their characters, there’s little incentive to stay interested., It’s a devilishly smart and self-aware take on the current trend for Eighties horror homage, lovingly adapted from Grady Hendrix’s 2016 novel of the same name."
X ,0,"Its crass and ghastly, with an on-the-nose premise fit for the often- sensationalist slasher genre and the salacious X-rated cinema embedded in this story., The characters are fleshed-out and kooky — you’ll mourn when they meet their inevitable slaughter. And for a slasher, the acting is remarkably good: Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth in particular are scene-stealers., X reanimates perennial fears of aging, older women, and one’s fading relevance., Theres tension, proper fleshiness that makes the audience wince, and the actors seem to be really enjoying themselves. Entertaining and repugnant, in a good way., This is really great, a throwback to those grindhouse films of the 1970s. , X is preoccupied with voyeurism across different generations, bringing together two genres - horror and porn - associated not just with the MPAAs X rating, but also with the male gaze. That gaze will be subverted and skewered..., West’s trademark slow build-up gives us every chance to imagine our own version of the mayhem on the way... To hold our attention in the meantime, he has another trick up his sleeve: making his characters sufficiently interesting and likeable., West just wants to punish everyone involved in gory ways played for laughs., X provides a map for how to do the classics right while still taking the formula somewhere original., I give West credit for having a vision and sticking to his own influences. He knows what he wants to do and how to execute it unapologetically., Ripe with playful winks and nudges., Sweaty, sexy and extremely fun slasher., Traipsing into danger is the essential playbook of horror, a path well-trodden. But the brutal, giddy-making X, written and directed by Ti West, makes that journey somehow feel both fresh and comfortingly familiar., Bloody. Brutal. Grungier than a big-city back alley and more guts-strewn than a slaughterhouse. This is how you like your slasher-flick horror, and trust us when we say Ti West has your back. , Like most of West’s films, X is not particularly ambitious in its psychology or storytelling. It’s his technique that makes his work feel like it has one foot in the arthouse..., X rips at the jugular with exuberant joy. This is old-school exploitation horror that isnt afraid to offend and doesnt care if the rough edges get sanded down., It’s deeply silly, but eminently watchable., The rare recent horror movie that remembers the genre is at its best when its fun, depraved and undercover smart., X is a fun movie – a throwback to the Grindhouse pictures of the 1970s and the slasher genre of the late ‘70s and early ‘80s., X pays off by showing what happens when characters are more than just meat for the grinder\xa0—\xa0or, for that matter, those doing the grinding."
Darby and the Dead,0,"Darby and the Dead is no game-changer but it is thoroughly enjoyable and energetic. , With a refreshingly diverse cast and a compelling premise, there’s a lot to appreciate about Darby and the Dead — even with its muddied execution., Darby and the Dead mashes up a host of YA movie tropes into a snappy but ultimately forgettable ride., As familiar as this tale of female transformation feels, there is an authentic sweetness to Darby and Capri’s fledgling friendship., This is not a great look for a modern movie aimed at girls, even one with production standards that call to mind a tween sitcom pilot. Indeed, there is little worse than a script built on contempt for its own characters."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,0,"This soulful sequel teams an emotional tribute to late star Chadwick Boseman with some spectacular visual action. A maturity milestone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starring Angela Bassett and Winston Duke., Kind of a mixed bag, but worth seeing if you liked the first one. , The MCU’s mechanics are too oppressive to allow for true mournful meditation., The first Black Panther... set a bar Wakanda Forever didnt come close to matching. But taken on its own terms, as a superhero sequel tasked with serving an unusually wide range of needs, it stands as a different kind of accomplishment., Wow! You’ll say that over and over again as this mind-blowing, superhero epic unfolds. Wow!, Wakanda Forever may not be the perfect Marvel movie, but it prove its worthiness as a bridge – not merely between Phase 4 and Phase 5... but from the bleakness of loss to a stable place from which a new generation can move forward. , The most unlikely Marvel film ever... they take these really small bites of grieving, and they can extend them and live in them, and still be able to tell an engaging action-oriented story. , I find I respect Coogler’s sequel more than I actually enjoyed it, and that’s as disappointing a turn of events as any I could have imagined., The emotional core is raw, credible and affecting., The opening and closing sequences of Wakanda Forever will make your heart ache. But at 2hrs 41mins, this is also one of the longest films in the MCU. And there are long stretches in it which border on boredom. I was weepy but also weary. , Coogler pulls off an incredible feat, despite some story stumbles, creating a superhero film that is emotionally affecting, politically and culturally urgent, and that pays loving tribute not just to T’Challa but Chadwick Boseman too., After a spate of manic superhero blockbusters that ricocheted from one digital spectacle to another, this one takes its time with character and plot but doesn’t develop either to any satisfying degree., A thoughtful and mature exploration of communal grief in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a fitting tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman., A stunning tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman., Fans of the MCU will doubtless embrace this at times moving sequel in a big way; for more serious cinemagoers this will remain a foreign country., The underwater sequences intended to visualize Talokan are drab and washed-out to the point of distraction, and even a street-level car chase shot at night is near-impossible to track, all the darkness seemingly intended to cover for lackluster CGI., Almost like being at a funeral while trying to shush the kids who are playing with their Iron Man toys. ... Its more fascinating than your average comic book movie, even though it doesnt work as a comic book movie., It can’t top the original and the absence of Chadwick Boseman hurts real bad, but Ryan Coogler’s sequel proves to be more than cringey franchise building by putting women of color in charge (yay to Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright) and watching them fly., For all its comic-book violence, over-the-top villainy, and too dark CGI, at its core this is a film about dealing with loss., “Wakanda Forever” is the first blockbuster wake, and it’s powered not by vibranium but by its vibrant and fully felt emotions."
Something in the Dirt,0,"Something in the Dirt has the gritty DIY-vibe of the no-budget world from which it sprang, and is both thought-provoking and crazy-making, just like the mood it presents., Ultimately, Something in the Dirt doesn’t quite convince as a genuine mystery -- and it doesn’t seem to be meant to. Having fun with the artifice of it all seems far more to the point. , What it has in abundance is genuine sadness. Benson and Moorhead direct and shoot their film smartly, but their performances are what ground it and give it shape., For those who are fine without finality, Something in the Dirt’s funky, frenetic paranoia is fun to hang out with for a while., For the first 90 minutes or so, there’s remarkable vibrancy and spontaneity to this picture, as its creators and stars seem to be coming up with their story on the spot, with the cameras rolling., An ambitious potluck of buddy comedy, paranormal puzzle and whatdunnit mystery, this fifth feature from the filmmaking team of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead cheerfully substitutes audacity for discipline., The film’s sheer fun and invention counterbalance its main characters’ abject failure in their search for meaning and success., While not quite on a level with The Endless, this is another pocket lint sci-fi from the current masters of such. A welcome sign that Benson and Moorhead haven’t gone fully respectable just yet., It wrings a mini-cosmos out of next to nothing, its delicately transcendent visuals – courtesy of Moorhead’s photography background – constantly signposting some higher truth just around the next corner., The end result is captivating yet slippery, and could be off-putting if it wasnt for the dynamic and cunning appeal of Benson and Moorhead., Their latest fusion of science fiction, character drama, dark comedy, and overwhelming paranoia, Something in the Dirt, feels like their most personal film., Its a little too long at 115 minutes, but theres a lot to like here from a pair of filmmakers who Im happy to see still taking crazy risks when it comes to storytelling and form., It\s fitting that the result should be dedicated to making movies with your friends, as it says in the end credits. For first-timers and fans alike, it can feel like watching your buddies\ latest project., Something in the Dirt impressively unfurls an ambitious feature from a simple idea, leaving you with a lot to chew on long after the credits roll., Even as the flow of the movie approaches incoherence, then rushes headlong past it, a redeeming strain of brotherly camaraderie takes root, even amid constant sniping and bitching., Something in the Dirt functions as a disturbing and acerbically comedic riddle of a movie where finding the answers is a secondary, mostly unfruitful goal., all at once unnerving found (and partly faked) footage, eccentric LA neo-noir and deliriously overcoded meta murder mystery, where an odd couples endlessly edited and re-edited recordings conceal as much as they reveal..."
White Noise ,0,"Above all, it is - not surprisingly - a marriage story, and the story of a family that, in its own bizarre way, might be the most functional and relatable Baumbach has ever portrayed., It’s another one of 2022’s high profile, star-encrusted projects that struggles to be as good as its dazzling cast and provocative premise. , White Noise is bursting with fun things to watch. And though the story takes place in the 1980s, it tackles present day preoccupations: human-caused disaster, media saturation, drug addiction and consumerism., The effect here is that Noah Baumbachs White Noise comes across far more sentimentally than DeLillo likely ever intended. Yet its forgiving nature is oddly comforting., Baumbach holds back from giving us anything truly bold. The film needed to be far more experimental and political to have something substantial to say about our viewing practices..., It’s funny and surprisingly unnerving stuff. The film also manages to feel contemporary without ever dropping the throwback aesthetic. , Baumbach overreaches in White Noise. The movie is unsuccessful because its various energies eventually begin to feel mismeasured.,  Kudos to Baumbach for trying something new, but White Noise is an endurance test., The result is a movie so faithful to the original work that it comes very close to not working., Noah Baumbach honors Don DeLillo’s virtuoso novel about the comic-absurdist chaos of consumerism with too cautious respect. The result is his most constricted film, which only breaks free when costars Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig fly on their own wings. , Baumbach’s pandemic-inspired undertones resonate on that level, but it’s played in such stilted fashion as to make White Noise pretty easy to tune out., DeLillo’s novel is a singular work. But Baumbach’s “White Noise” is worthwhile in its own way., The structural problems remain: there’s a campus comedy, a disaster flick, and a crime caper that never cohere, but I liked Baumbach’s Gladney family much more than DeLillo’s..., The costumiers and make-up folk have worked hard on Gerwig and Driver, but both still look dressed-up for a particularly boring Halloween Party – the former as 1980s Deirdre Barlow, the latter as recovering trainspotter., Departing from his comfort zone of neurotic, yet very relatable characters Baumbach has managed to deliver something rather special here. , Here, forays into broad comedy and slapstick falter, drawing attention in all the wrong ways... Still, the entire cast is pitch-perfect, everyone inhabiting their roles with an expert ease., DeLillo’s novel has long been considered to be “unadaptable” due to how it succeeded in telling an expansive yet intimate story of postmodern peril. Despite this, Baumbach has managed to mostly do it justice..., If a film could smirk, this one would., Even with a black cloud literally chasing this family and much talk of the inevitability of death, White Noise has a weirdly optimistic side as well., Don DeLillo’s postmodern classic has long been regarded as impossible to adapt. Noah Baumbach’s attempt for Netflix does nothing to change that."
The Bounty Hunter ,0,", , , , , , , Even considered as no more than an assembly-line Hollywood product, The Bounty Hunter falls well below factory standards., Theres so little chemistry between the two, they might as well have cast Mick Fleetwood and Samantha Fox and had done with it., You know its bad when a caper comedy makes you long for the Goldie Hawn-Chevy Chase showcases of yore..., There cannot be many of these back-of-the-envelope-cutesy ideas for rom-coms left., The romantic pairing of brawny Gerard Butler and wispy Jennifer Aniston is a sight for sore eyes but makes for sore brains long before the end of Andy Tennants rom-com., The Bounty Hunter marks a new low and a new genre: the bail-bondage rom-com., Averagely routine, routinely average romcom., Therell be worse films released in 2010 -- but not many., Death, taxes, Gerard Butler. Wish them away all you like: still they befall us., The story of a bail enforcer who captures his newspaper-reporter ex-wife manages to be both formulaic and patchwork, with whatever twinkles that exist between the stars eclipsed by the overall crudeness., The film is stuffed with these idiosyncratic micro-roles (I loved Siobhan Fallon Hogan as the bondsmans secretary), which prove more diverting than the two main characters., The latest evidence that, when it comes to romantic combat, we live in a more thoughtlessly brutal age than our ancestors did., At points, the film sinks below the level of competent: A stupid plot trick early on is so badly edited that it takes another minute to figure out whats supposed to be going on."
Standing Ovation ,0,"Parents and anyone beyond adolescence will find it an intolerable attempt to cash in by imitating films theyve seen before., For us grinchy adults out there without children to sedate, the whole thing feels slightly less like a movie than like the filmed record of a mutiny at a juvie talent agency., Despite its absurdly optimistic title, Standing Ovation deserves a resounding chorus of boos, and maybe a few well-aimed tomatoes., Standing Ovation is an innovative film in the sense that every minute or so it comes up with a different way of being annoying., A glittery string of backstage conventions. Backstabbing! Pushy parents! Precocious stars! Blind ambition! But if youre a tween (and dont watch Glee), the cliches will be new to you., Its a bubblegum mess, lacking structure, coherence,and any sense of drama. But it manages moments of daft fun, sometimes in spite of itself."
Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll ,0,"A cringe-worthy script chock-full of clichés., This hard-nosed drama comes across like one of those BBC4 hatchet jobs on iconic Brits., If only the words I want to use to describe Andy Serkis performance - charismatic, compelling - also applied to the movie around him., Stands up pretty well as a celebration of Dury., The acting generally is first-class, but what holds the film together is the performance of Andy Serkis., Andy Serkis uncoils a performance of spit, grit and wit so ferocious it only serves to starkly clarify how unremarkable and formulaic the rest of the movie is., Serkis is such a live wire that the supporting actors (Olivia Williams, Naomie Harris, Ray Winstone) can do little but stand back in awe. Its the rare instance where such admiration is earned., Still, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll has a peppy, funny and ultimately inspiring biopic with enjoyable supporting turns including Ray Winstone., Somehow this well-intentioned film cannot help but turn an uncompromisingly original artist into a formula., While it feels slapdash rather than properly punk-collage ragged, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll is an honest job, and it makes a good case for including Durys work and personality in any Brit-culture list of Reasons to be Cheerful., Its an energetic and vivacious film that will appeal to fans of punk rock worldwide and should find its place in the pantheon of great music-film biographies., A strong central performance from Andy Serkis as the late British punk rocker Ian Dury powers Mat Whitecross directorial debut through a fractured 113 minutes., Paul Viraghs script is too bitty to hold it all together, and filigrees of technique fail to disguise the weaknesses in helmer Mat Whitecross first solo flight., A sometimes whimsical and magical take on the life of one of Britains most artistically charged rock stars. Serkis shines in his role as the troubled singer., There are no allusions to the empowering nature of punk that catalyses the tale; and strangest of all, theres not enough made of the funny, funky music that made him filmworthy in the first place. The result, too often, rings like a missed beat., A barnstorming, passionate performance from Andy Serkis brings 1970s music legend Ian Dury stunningly back to life in this gutsy biopic., Enlivened by some strong performances and a convincing emotional core, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll is a family melodrama in rock n roll trousers. But man, it knows how to wear them., The movie is a mite overstretched - how much florid anarchy can an audience take at one sitting? - but it makes last months rock biopic, the Lennonographic Nowhere Boy, seem the essay in decorous torpor it was., What the film tries to project as Durys loveable irascibility too often just looks like charmlessness., All of this comes to life in the movie thanks to the film-makers inventiveness, but - even more so - thanks to the performance of Andy Serkis as Dury."
Jack Goes Boating,0,"Cant shake off its stagey roots and lacks any emotional punch., Theres an improvisatory air, overlaid with quirky charm but never any bite. Hoffmans performance needs tougher, more focused direction., In places it has the airless feel of an over-workshopped piece, but is rescued by excellent performances: in particular Amy Ryan as Connie, Jacks shy would-be girlfriend., With fine and affecting performances all round, this is an enjoyably old-fashioned ensemble piece and a solid start to a career behind the camera., Take Jacks lead and give this one a miss., Philip Seymour Hoffman puts his oar in with a tender, thoughtful adaption of Robert Glaudinis stage play. A little too measured to deliver an emotional punch, its nevertheless beautifully acted and at times rather lovely., , The magnitude of the acting overshadows the modest reach of the material., Hoffman the director cant compete with Hoffman the films star. And he can pretty much just stand in wonder at the layers co-star Amy Ryan brings to the party. The woman is a natural wonder., The movies heart and story, both bleeding and mending, and its quartet of characters are hard to abandon -- and easy to care about., Jacks a good guy, and you root for him all the way to the end, but, wistfully, that doesnt make him an any more interesting everyday Joe than he is., It belatedly reveals itself to be a meditation on the different kinds of loneliness, presenting isolation as a form of social stage fright., Jack Goes Boating is extremely well-acted and full of moments I adored, its just the final product itself that sadly left me cold., Making his feature directing debut, Hoffman shows considerable generosity toward the other players, which was probably a good idea given his own listless performance as the mumbling title character., The adults-acting-badly genre is popular in the art-house scene -- Noah Baumbach perhaps being its king -- but despite its wincing moments, Jack has a much sweeter heart than its darker cousins., A subtle, slow-moving drama of moments and repercussions that works due to the talents of its cast and quality of its source material despite a few notable flaws., Hoffman brings all the methodical excellence that has made him such a force as an actor to his first outing as a director with the tender story of awkward, middle-aged love, betrayal and consequences in Jack Goes Boating., Jack Goes Boating is a successful work of art. To see this movie is to feel that youve lived it., Hoffmans direction is a mixture of skill and showiness. Hes attentive to all the actors, but he cant resist cute camera angles and Fellini-esque touches that dont quite fit this story., This is one of those rare movies that genuinely likes its characters and wishes them the best; as agonizing as it can be to watch Jack fumble toward human connection, Hoffman knows the fumblings the point."
The Artist ,0,"The fiction, ultimately, is the thing. The Artist, in the best possible sense, is more of a movie than a film. Its played for laughs and tears; it switches from action to tenderness; its got a really funny dog., The Artist is simply a pleasure to watch, if only for just two hours in time., Michel Hazanavicius black-and-white, mostly silent comedy The Artist is a gorgeously made curiosity -- a film that functions as a testament to its own obsession with other movies., Uplifting, heart-warming, hilarious... not necessarily words youd expect to apply to a black and white silent French film. But The Artist is no ordinary movie., The Artist is drunk on the history of cinema and art, and culture buffs will get giddy on it., Retro but totally modern, frivolous yet fundamentally serious, The Artist is a thing of grace and joy and a great American film -- of the sort it takes the French to make., Glorious, delicious and an unalloyed joy... I loved it. Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it., Sometimes cinema should just be pure, unadulterated joy, and The Artist is precisely that, in every wordless frame., Through it all, Dujardin has great dignity, is hugely likeable, and pulls off touches of comic poignancy not far from Chaplins., The result is an irresistible delight., The whole thing is so damn clever and charming, it might just sneak off with Best Picture., It isnt arty or intellectual, though it is artful and ingenious, and its the rare crowd-pleaser that never feels obvious or pandering., There is literally nothing wrong with it. I dont have a single nit to pick, minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last., You cant fault it as smart entertainment, which eschews parody to make a sincere tribute that also serves as cogent current commentary., The movie ever fully shakes off its air of skillfully executed experiment, but its spirited and charming nonetheless., A glorious spectacle that captivates the senses and energizes the mind, The Artist is a full-bodied sensation that had me doing interior cartwheels while I sat in the theatre gluttonously consuming each and every morsel., A sweet, sincere, massively overrated valentine to silent movies., Simply irresistible., Not just a re-creation of an archaic technique -- the characters are real, vivid, and affecting. The movie transcends its story to be more than a tribute to a simpler time., For a movie that is so much about technique, its surprising how affecting the story is."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",0,"Looking back, its strange to remember that the first two movies were both hits, and that Paul Giamatti and Terrence Howard even saw enough in the premise to sign up for the original. At this point, its really all just flab., Im no fan of Perrys blunt-force morality comedies, but at least his pseudo-sainted materfamilias is a real character., Its a true rubber-neckers delight, a comedy so inconceivably tacky that it will make you question whether or not youre laughing at the film or with it., Can there really be a comparative and a superlative for unfunny? It doesn\t make sense to describe this witless, embarrassing third film in the Big Momma franchise as the unfunniest., An assessment of the film as part of a dissertational examination of Lawrences contribution to comedic posterity and to African-American cultural history will surely note that the film was not pre-screened for critics in advance., Even Big Momma deserves better than this., It seems fair to point out that of all the cross-dressing comedies of recent decades, none has channeled Some Like It Hot quite so thoroughly., A film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact., If Tyler Perry finds liberation in lipstick, Lawrence has become suffocated by Spanx., Lawrences gender-bending jokes are played out, and his slapstick is wooden and slow. Its understandable: Clowning around underneath that fat suit must be exhausting. Almost as much as watching it., Theres little that is fresh and nothing at all inventive about scenes involving the brandishing and firing of guns, the unfunny excesses of a putatively comical car chase, and the repetitious sass and brass of Big Mommas life lessons., This extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial clichs., Agonisingly slow and laughter-free., This is not a case of doubling the fun so much as an anxious attempt to revive a franchise running out of gas., The airless Matthew Fogel-Don Rhymer script makes one long for the snark and sass of Madea., Among this films many misdemeanours is pinching the plot of Some Like It Hot., Whoever demanded a third instalment of Lawrences mirthless mash-up of weak gags and cross-dressing horrors should be imprisoned and forced to watch it on repeat until they repent. Avoid., Quite how this flaccid, one-joke crime-comedy franchise even got off the ground is a mystery., Its amazing really, when you look back at the Big Mommas House film series, how many major crimes can be solved by dressing up as a fat woman."
The Iron Lady ,0,"The Iron Lady is a better performance than it is film, although I suspect the performance will carry the day., While the movie tries to cultivate Thatchers life, its not perfect. But the chemistry between Broadbent and Streep to elevate an untold romance beautifully elevates the flawed movie., So, as thrilling as it is to watch Streep imitate Thatcher, The Iron Lady feels like a missed opportunity, not to blame and cast aspersions, but to weigh and assess., , Can a mediocre movie be made worthwhile by a single performance?, , If the idea is to humanise the woman, its rather wasted. If theres one thing Margaret Thatcher wont be remembered for, its her humanity., , What keeps The Iron Lady afloat is the mesmerizing work of its star. As we already know, Streep goes beyond mimicry to fully inhabit her characters, from The French Lieutenants Woman to Julia Child., Yes, Streep is wondrous as usual, but her superpowers have been squandered here., Often The Iron Lady relies on montages to get to - and plow through - historic high points., Streeps performance overpowers the movie its in - a perfectly executed triple axel that renders everything else just featureless ice., Streeps performance is so true and so uncannily accurate, so full and so complete in its understanding, that she is fascinating every second she is onscreen., Streep, no fan of Thatcher, nicely undercuts the poignancy of her current condition with flashbacks that reveal her brittle arrogance in office., A performance by Meryl Streep of endless intelligence cannot keep this portrait of Thatcher from being the sentimental nonsense she spent her career trying to avoid., While the rest of The Iron Lady fades quickly in memory, Meryl Streep\s performance in the title role remains startlingly present., Everything Streep does here is a seismic act of theater. If she so much as tilts her head, the earth tilts with it. She doesnt simply overwhelm this thin historic biography - and the other actors around her - she detonates it., The portrait that Streep delivers in Phyllida Lloyds impressionistic biopic is astonishing., Streep is Oscar-worthy here, as she almost always is, which is hardly a surprise, and the historic subject matter is fascinating whichever way your politics may lean., A stylized biography of one of the most powerful women in politics, portrayed by the greatest actress of our time, that asks more questions than it answers."
Hop ,0,"Props, though, to the WTF musical interlude featuring the Blind Boys of Alabama., Kids will love Brands frenetic drumming take on E.B., adults will love that there are a few clandestine adult jokes., Perfectly pleasant, funny, if unexceptional Easter holiday movie., Hop is the kind of movie that makes helpless critics wish we could stage an intervention. Parents! It doesnt have to come to this!, The film is bright and breezy and the animation is first rate. Some of the jokes are lame, and its more a film for younger, and less sophisticated children., For the most part it tries too hard, lurching from one plot contrivance to another and never giving any of its cast (apart from the heroically hard-working Marsden) much to do., Gone are the days of childlike mystery, and in their place we have the childish Hop., Its a combination of the worst movies about trouble in Santa Clauss north pole toy factory and a version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory lethally laced with sugar., The bunny-gets-injured, slacker-saves-Easter plotline doesnt pack too much predictability but Brand does his best with the material and its cute enough for kids., The lack of any comparable reality check will make this one an endurance test for most people who arent five., Other than some truly obnoxious and out of place sexual innuendos that serve no purpose and have no reason to be in the film other than to help it achieve a PG rating, this is a picture unashamedly geared towards little kids under the age of ten., As fake and forgettable as a marshmallow Peep, Hop goes down easy enough. It\s the thought of a talented actor stuck on an industry conveyor belt that leaves an unfortunate aftertaste., Hop is spectacularly charmless -- theres no spring in its step. The last thing we need is an Easter movie that comes limping down the bunny trail., Though the integration of live action and animation is improving (especially a scene where E.B. cuddles with Freds sister), its still a slightly disorienting experience., Hop is just too shrill, slick and sickly sweet for anybodys good. Watching it wont rot your teeth, but it could leave an ugly cavity in your brain., Hop is a hodge-podge of a movie in which stretches of dull subplots and narrative stagnation are broken up by an occasional good laugh., A fun and funny mix of live action and animation that puts the hop back into Easter., Hop integrates animated characters into live-action settings, relying on director Tim Hill to handle the logistics of convincingly blending both worlds., Flop would be closer., It may be okay for kids under 10 but this anodyne movie will try the patience of the family audience for whom it strives mightily."
Jane Eyre ,0,"What it does right it does very right. It is stunningly mounted, for example... But what it does wrong is fatal, and the error is this: it just isnt passionate or sexy enough., Jane Eyre triumphs with a suitably bleak landscape and an excellent performance from Michael Fassbender, but the restrained tone lets it down., , Screenwriter Moira Buffini sticks pretty closely to the novel, and director Cary Fukunaga conjures a drab tone that nicely sets off the characters violent but rigidly controlled passions., The direction by Cary Fukunaga is real by-the-numbers rote., The new Jane Eyre is notably well-made in almost every respect and should you want to watch an adaptation of the story just now, highly recommendable., Some works of art are inexhaustible, and this is proving one of them., Spot on., Those craving gloomy stairways and thunderclap atmospherics might not come away completely sated, but Fukunagas delicate artistry leaves it hard to ask for much more., In approaching the material with respect, restraint and simple good taste, Fukunaga has created something strangely revelatory., This adaptation is balanced, crafted, beautifully acted, though for me without the thunderclap and lightning-bolt of passion., This is no plain Jane., Theres no question its stunningly mounted, and Wasikowska makes a much stronger Jane than Alice, but the romance is overripe and the climax underdone., Following his impressive feature debut, Sin Nombre, director Cary Fukunaga has brought his keen eye and humanistic sensibilities to this oft-told story., If the motion-picture industry had existed in 1847, the year Charlotte Bronts novel appeared, it might have produced an adaptation much like this one., The Eyre/Rochester romance has inspired happy sighs for 160 years and in these days, when so little is repressed that no one makes time for smolder, it still delivers., It is a movie that has delved into the nooks and crannies of the authors brain unlike any other before it that I have seen, and for that reason alone I do call it a triumph and a motion picture most definitely worth the time to experience for ones self., Somehow Wasikowska makes it all seem much more personal, more real. With her stark, starched dresses and blunt, elastic face, she draws you in, making both Janes pain and incredible resolve tangible., An atmospheric, absorbing version of the classic romance between an abandoned, plucky orphan and a wealthy, mysterious older man with a seriously Gothic secret., By opening their movie with the mature Jane, the filmmakers forge an emotional bond between her and the audience."
"Crazy, Stupid, Love",0,"Despite some shaky plotting, the Carell and Gosling duo is an engaging watch and the two have their own special brand of chemistry that keeps the film going, even when things feel just ludicrous enough to be distracting., The acting is universally excellent, and during the majority of the films running time whats taking place is almost too glorious for words., Steve Carell sets aside his goofball schtick for a more earthy role in this satisfying, mature ensemble romantic dramedy., Its several cuts above the average romantic comedy that weve been getting lately and Ive been sort of railing against those, because theyre not romantic and theyre not funny but this is both romantic and funny., There may not be much competition, but its among the best of the year., It ties its strands together a touch too tightly two-thirds of the way through - but still leaves enough hanging at the end to be credible., For long stretches, Glenn Ficarra and John Requas Crazy, Stupid, Love is a sharp, decidedly superior romantic comedy whose top-rate performers and fizzy dialogue go a long way to overcoming its tired set-up., Maudlin, glossy, overextended., A hilarious insight into the world of dating, with a lorra, lorra laughs to be had., This is witless, saccharine and lifeless..., The kind of film that makes you want to call someone the minute its over, even if just to tell them to go see this movie., When a movie opens with a woman telling her husband that she wants a divorce after twenty-five years of marriage and it isn\t played for laughs, you know you\re not in for a typical Hollywood comedy..., Theres strong, fleetingly powerful stuff in Crazy, Stupid, Love., but like its awkwardly punctuated title, the movie jerks to a halt just when its beginning to flow., Its a tempestuous up and down storyline of laughing and sighing., It gets better and funnier after a labored and lumbering start, which is entirely the opposite of most Hollywood comedies., A few contrivances too many make this otherwise appealing romantic comedy seem occasionally ungainly, yet its sensational cast manages to breezily flick away most distractions., The movie is going for a wistful romanticism. For me it was more like a pervy sociopathy., This is not the ultimate romantic comedy - the one that makes you fall as hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoring their every interaction - but it seems fresher and less recycled than much of the product out there., ...Steve Carell and Julianne Moore play their scenes honestly and believably, so while the characters and incidents around them become farcical at times, the core of the film remains subdued and even melancholy. Both actors are likable so we want..., This is the sort of film that Oscar generally ignores come awards season. It shouldnt. Crazy Stupid Love is a crazy smart film."
Zookeeper ,0,", From the unstoppable Adam Sandler hit factory comes this pleasant, kid-friendly, ultra-formulaic shlub-does-good comedy., Fans of the sight of James falling over will get a big kick out of Zookeeper, but this deranged comedy will leave everyone else scratching their heads., To produce something as emphatically unfunny as this, the scripts five-man team must have whipped themselves into a state of mutual delusion., If as much money had gone into the screenplay as must have gone into the paying for the star voices we might have ended up with something less mundane., In which Kevin James yet again proves his absolute unfitness (in both senses) for the part of romantic comedy lead., Kevin James is the hero of this comedy, which boasts five screenwriters and not a single amusing moment., The comedy premise is confused and underwhelming while the formulaic romance is a waste of the charismatic leads., Funniest moments? The outtakes during the closing credits. I rest my case., Some sparks of comedy and fun but largely a flat and unrewarding comedy., Kevin James has developed an irresistible screen persona as a nice-guy/underdog, which has served him well in some pretty mediocre films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop. In that context, Zookeeper is a quantum leap forward..., Perhaps the madcap adventures of a love-lorn middle aged man is not exactly kids stuff. But it sure isnt for the adults in the audience either., I think there should be a subdivision of the ASPCA -- American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences., Did we mention that things just go better with Kevin James? Well-trodden comedy hooks become strangely more amusing. Goofball physical shtick elicits broader smiles. The bumblingly stupid is made endearing., Im not gonna sugarcoat this: Movies dont have to be this bad., Kevin James has developed an irresistible screen persona as a nice-guy/underdog, which has served him well in some pretty mediocre films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop. In that context, Zookeeper is a quantum leap forward,..., The movie is all concept and no execution, a few decent lines and a couple of nice sight gags not enough to make even partly worthy of a potential viewers time., Will most audiences mind this? Probably not. Should they? Of course. They deserve better and frankly, so does Kevin James., Unfortunately, nobody had the good sense to call the comedy authorities and shut this Zookeeper down., Offensive to women, men, children, parents, WASPs, Asians, African-Americans, animals and zookeepers … a movie with no conceivable audience."
Soul Surfer ,0,"Soul Surfer is a heavy-handed plea for sympathy that doesnt do the real-life story justice., Clearly Bethany was quite a girl but this film prompts one simply to say Amen., The film that follows is thin and frothy, though watch out for that final sentimental upsurge. It could drag and lift you against your will., Its clear that Quaid learned nothing from Jaws 3., A surf film employing massive amounts of CG is incredible for all the wrong reasons., A succession of would-be rousing clichés., Soul Surfer seems simply too sugar-coated to be true., The brazenly cheap look to the special effects sends the film into MST3K territory, and its certainly the most hilariously awful surprise attack by a shark since Samuel L. Jackson got devoured by one in Deep Blue Sea., You wonder why this movie isnt a documentary, rather than a synthetic feature film with the heroines arm digitally removed., Hamilton is played, blandly, by Anna Sophia Robb, and her devoted parents, less bland, are played by Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt. The surfing footage, much of it shot off the coast of Kauai, is not bland at all., Its Bethany and Alanas friendship - its sturdiness and vulnerability, its laughs and sincere apologies - that rules the day., A by-the-numbers biopic about young surfer Bethany Hamilton., An inspiring tale, even when true, doesnt necessarily make for an inspiring movie., Given the heroic subject, the movie is as thrilling as a dish of rice pudding, a made-for-TV-style effort that rides a wave of religious sentiment into theatres., The swells of inspirational storytelling sometimes threaten to swamp the underlying inspirational story., The flaw in the storytelling strategy of Soul Surfer is that it doesn\t make Bethany easy to identify with. She\s almost eerie in her optimism. Her religious faith is so unshaken, it feels taken for granted., Shamelessly pandering to the elusive Christian family audience, a committee of 18 producers and seven writers has removed nearly every trace of grit from this airbrushed portrait., Its a compelling tale of surf and survival., Does nearly everything you expect it to, but it does it more likably and satisfyingly than you might think it would., Its bubbling optimism and spectacular scenery are hard not to like."
Paranormal Activity 4,0,"A rickety old ride and no mistake, this instalment is for franchise fans only., Were still seeing things through handheld devices and built-in laptop cameras, even though nobody seems interested in looking at the footage the cameras were supposedly recording., Even for a something about supernatural shenanigans, this ending is embarrassing., They could have called this Paranormal Inactivity., The mood is often playful, with teases and fake-outs that are sometimes humorous and usually right before shocks. Violence is rare, quick and devoid of lingering close-ups., Sadly continues the series downslide, most drearily with a mid-film twist that enables the filmmakers to go about essentially remaking the second entry., There are at least a half-dozen or so decent jolts to be enjoyed over the films running time, but prepare for a long wait to actually get to them., The mythology has deepened, largely to the negative, and the formula is as rigid as the fixins of a fast-food sandwich-tastes the same in every city. But the effects are eternally reliable., Screenwriter Christopher Landon, along with co-directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, make a truly lame attempt at establishing a supernatural mythology to explain all this ..., Its all faint-by-numbers this time, without even a cool device like the low-tech fan cam from PA3 to interest us or really scare us., There is still activity, I regret to report, and none of it is of the normal variety., The scares are hit-and-miss, but at least Alex and Ben are fun to hang out with., Achieves a degree of success, but franchise quality is clearly starting to crack and give way to the gimmick., Mostly, it plays like a overlong prologue for the already-in-the-works PA5. Heres hoping this is just the tension-racking lull before the next big scream., The franchise that capitalized on the found-footage craze has gotten lost., This films strong suit is that it finally feels contemporary., Of course, a promise of more activity to come. But unless moviegoers think its worth watching another whole cast of characters sleep while their furniture moves around them, only diehard fans will stay awake for that next entry., If weve learned nothing else from horror films, its that little kids are weird and probably possessed, so, you know, when you see one coming toward you, its best to run the other way., Catfish pair Joost and Ariel Schulman keep the franchise firmly on track with a satisfyingly scary fourth instalment., Theres a point at which movies become only merchandise, and the Paranormal franchise may be heading for that nexus, that nadir."
The Avengers ,0,"The comedic timing, coupled with his ability to maintain the authenticity of the characters, is worthy of praise. The Avengers delivers a popcorn feast thats the perfect summer kickoff., Downeys Stark/Iron Man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty, but the CGI effects are amazing and, despite its length, the film is very enjoyable., This will be loved by genre fans, when all is said and done/ But at two hours forty, you may find it numbs your bum/ Seriously, more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun/ And now I have said all that, I believe my poem is done., If we must have these box-office behemoths, then at least the writer-director, Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a lively controlling influence., Of course its about one hundred times brighter than Transformers and Michael Bays imbecilic spinoffs, and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip. But I didnt love it., After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind., Whedon manages all these disparate threads confidently, his script a model of self-control and restraint thats far from typical for the genre., Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash., If you are a Marvel fan, then The Avengers will feel like Christmas. Thanks to the merry doings of the director, Joss Whedon, all your favorite characters are here, as shiny and as tempting as presents under the tree., A movie that yells at you and geeks out in equal measures., Ultimately, it all comes back to Whedon: His clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny, tender, immaculately constructed script., A spectacle in the grandest sense of the word ..., Its easy to turn NIck Furys blind eye to the movies flaws because at the end of the day The Avengers packs big explosions, bigger personalities and Hulk-sized punch lines., ...there arent many writer-directors as talented as Joss Whedon. Indeed, its the writing that sets this film apart from the crowd, in harmony with perfect casting, first-rate visual effects, and other key ingredients., Whedon, a pop-genre magician best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a master of viewer manipulation - because he never gives up his own seat in the crowd., The performances are so well-pitched in The Avengers, meshing with such vividness and ease, that its tempting to overpraise the good but not great movie that surrounds them., The film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom., Its two-plus hours of visual brawn, unexpected heartbeats and welcome humor., Its primary purpose is not to explore or subvert the superhero movie, but to lay the groundwork for more of them., A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-Transformers to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax."
Alex Cross ,0,"... Alex Cross is certainly the weakest of the series, which reportedly will continue with Perry in the next film. God help us all. We can only hope for the best with that one., Perry has rarely been less convincing than when locking and loading from his home arsenal or dangling from a decaying Detroit edifice., Alex Cross is coarse, punishing, and, in all the ways that matter, conscienceless ..., So cloddish, slapdash, gracelessly written, and visually fugly that its difficult to distinguish Perrys limitations in the role from those of the whole unpleasant enterprise., A strong candidate for dumbest film of the year ..., For a franchise with an off-the-charts nuanced thinker as its protagonist, Alex Cross isnt very smart., You may be expecting just a standard mystery/thriller. Youll get a mess thats so poorly constructed that if it were a pilot for a cop show, no network would pick it up., Tyler Perry finds it easier to step out of Madeas dress than into Morgan Freemans shoes in the thriller Alex Cross, a trite attempt at franchise building., Stripped down to his undershirt or brandishing an assault rifle, Perry looks both incongruous and ridiculous - an icon out of water., It feels almost cruel to laugh at such a blindly stumbling, dunderheaded action-thriller, but you wont be able to help it., There\s still a marketplace for a smart, well-crafted cat-and-mouse thriller. But Alex Cross isn\t it., Cohen squanders a surprisingly recognizable cast on a half-baked plot adapted from James Pattersons series of novels., The first thing you\ll want to know about Alex Cross is: Can Tyler Perry carry it off? The answer is: Sort of, but not really., Alex Cross is a good example of what a seriously talented director can do with a heaping pile of garbage., Alex Cross is a misfire, but its sometimes an entertaining one - enough to make you curious about who else Perry could go up against in another installment, and just how much overacting would take place., The opening scene of Alex Cross serves notice of what\s to come by taking us down into a Detroit sewer., A grim, dispiritingly stupid waste of time, energy, money and talent ..., The 65″ Perrys most believable moment is when his character has to reach something from a high shelf. That feels real., Cross has a really bad temper, really big guns and really bad dialogue. He will use all of them excessively if pushed., As goofy as it is gruesome."
Ek Tha Tiger,0,"Maybe no one really sees anything in a Bhai film. It is just a mandatory event to be compulsorily thrilled by., I had fun while it lasted., Of course its played out like a comic book but if youre willing to suspend disbelief theres fun to be had., Salman Khan dazzles in rollicking -- and romantic -- Indian action thriller., Result boasts some excellent action sequences, most performed by megastar Salman Khan, and indeed is generally more effective in fight scenes than in hearts-and-flowers mode., Tiger and Zoya both make good kung fu street fighters, but as spies theyre unconvincing, and as lovers theyre cookie-cutter bland."
The Guilt Trip ,0,"A bit eww in that its essentially a romcom with a mom and son, its the perfect Mothers Day outing for people who dont like their mums much., The Guilt Trip struck me something best viewed on an airplane., Streisand has lost little of her gawky, pesky touch in comedy, while Rogen knows just how to be the charmingly daft slob., What were left with is a bafflingly dull road movie. Maybe Alexander Payne could have done something with this., It is the makers who should feel guilty., I had a lot of fun watching Barbra Streisand, who effortlessly commands the screen and reminds us what a gifted, natural comedienne she is., Andrew Rogen, who has invented an organic cleaning compound, pitches it to retailers in a succession of meetings across the country that have no grounding in any known reality., The Guilt Trip pairs Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand in the hope, no doubt, that sparks will fly. They dont., Rogen and Streisand are reasonably funny together, though Rogen, always best when hes angry, is crowded into the role of a well-mannered straight man., To its detriment, The Guilt Trip opts to work gently on the heart rather than hard on the funny bone., A breezy, funny and warm road-trip comedy., This film completely surrenders to its premise, with everything else following in a predictable way., The Guilt Trip is clearly targeted at older audiences less than receptive to the crude jokes that made Seth Rogen famous., It zigs when you expect it to zag. Its perceptive and thoughtful as it swerves around potholes that easily could have broken an axle., The films feel-good message is undermined by its ultimate purpose: As a vindication of the rights of Jewish mothers to annoy their children as much as they please., Mothers and sons deserve an amiable comedy they can share, but this one is faulty long before the requisite freeway breakdown., While Streisand and Rogens relationship is smartly, affectionately drawn, just about every other element of the movie feels perfunctory ..., It doesnt take every predictable detour, but it takes enough that the movie never ceases to feel overly familiar., Theres a reason Rogens best work in film has been providing voices for animated characters. He only has two looks, a squinchy pained look and a dull confused look., The Guilt Trip is tripe, but it\s tripe that knows its audience. Seriously, take your mother. It\ll be a mitzvah."
Jab Tak Hai Jaan,0,"Almost miraculously, the disparate elements add up to an improbably entertaining hybrid., I didnt buy into the story, but I bought into the heartfelt performances., JTHJ struggles hard to find its own two feet to stand on., Finally, what keeps you with the film is Shah Rukh Khan, who is on the top of his game., A sumptuous if rather soulless love story., Romance king Yash Chopra delivers a swoon-worthy Bollywood love story., Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra., Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this storys muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties."
The Bourne Legacy ,0,"This is not the Bourne sequel you were looking for., (Renner) has the required intensity and physicality to make his character-a highly-trained, genetically enhanced undercover agent-completely believable., The Bourne Legacy exists only as a failed attempt to squeeze more juice out of a once-reputable franchise, which is hardly a legacy worth leaving., The Bourne Legacy is quieter, slower, more sobering. The conspiracy is bigger and darker than we thought., Theres enough there, in all likelihood, to make audiences hope for more, but its not as finished or complete a work as it should have been., Jeremy Renner takes over the franchise and lends his character a menacing charm., Where The Bourne Ultimatum was a lesson in how to construct a jargon-heavy, location-hopping, it-goes-all-the-way-up-to-the-top spy thriller, The Bourne Legacy is a lesson in how not to., Shares crucial DNA with the earlier films but is drawn from the shallower end of the gene pool., Gilroy hasnt locked down every last task and stumbles at the end, but he keeps an awful lot spinning for an awfully long time., Everything Gilroy and crew concoct only serves to mock the excellence and passion with which Greengrass delivered his films., Aaron Cross immediately registers as a more vulnerable and sympathetic protagonist than his predecessor., Perhaps the most interesting question arising from The Bourne Legacy is just how long the filmmakers hope to trade on the Bourne name without any, you know, Bourne., Gilroy (who co-wrote the film with his brother Dan) doesnt skimp on high-octane action, from Renners introductory scenes of survival in a snowy wilderness, to his violent first meeting with Weisz, through a slam-bang chase climax., Might pass muster as a serviceable, if infuriatingly coy, Bourne spin-off if the lead were not so woefully miscast., The whole thing remains peculiarly abstract - theres nothing to invest in here, no pre-existing couple under threat, no child in peril, no one to root for. No lighter moments either., Renner and Weisz work well together as two hunted souls who initially need each other for utilitarian reasons., Gilroys a fine writer - he also penned Michael Clayton - but without the discipline of an action veteran like Greengrass to rein him in, he indulges his weakness to over-explain things., This franchise is going to have to come up with something pretty special if it hopes to limp past this miserable entry., The Bourne Legacy is one of Alfred Hitchcock\s refrigerator movies, in that it succeeds pretty well in the moment but starts to fall apart when considered in retrospect., The movies last hour or so squanders these rich narrative possibilities in an incoherently plotted, generically action-packed anticlimax."
Oblivion ,0,"Its a shame that its poor editing inhibits what could have been a memorable movie., Heres the trouble with mainstream science fiction filmmaking these days: theres no expectation that an audience is capable of putting things together or waiting for a payoff., The story that eventually surfaces is no where near as interesting as the mesmerizing look of the film., Although it looks spectacular and boasts some pungent ideas, the surprise-to-running-time ratio is out of whack., As a piece of narrative, though, its portentous, sluggish and fatally ungripping., It takes more than an hour for Oblivion to become whatever it is the filmmakers think its supposed to be., In space, Jack hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn., Large-scale, original sci-fi is a hard thing to come by these days, and despite its familiar story Oblivion does dream up some great ideas, Feels ever more grounded and stuck ..., Ultimately, Oblivion is aptly named - no other movie so far this year has been so instantly forgettable., Was Cruise trying to beat out fellow Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi epic ever?, If nothing else, Oblivion will go down in film history as the movie where Tom Cruise pilots a white, sperm-shaped craft into a giant space uterus., This is the sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band., Glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered., The story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes but, as with so many other Cruise productions, the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice., The sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me - and many other people, I suspect - to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski., Oblivion is an okay blockbuster, a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence., Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end). Yes, a great deal is derivative, but its fast-moving derivative., Absent of any sense of self-awareness, Oblivion seems only self-serious, a ponderous mess both misguided and unaware., More adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, Oblivion makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn\t let you go."
Side Effects ,0,"Steven Soderbergh has crafted a meticulously treacherous Hitchcockian thriller; the atmosphere crackles with sexual tension and betrayal. , Dr. Banks battle against evil lesbian scheme-hatchery sculpts him into a perfect husband, father, and doctor. Its surprising there isnt an epilogue to the film of him undergoing yet another transformation-this time into a saint, or maybe Superman., Side Effects showcases much of what the just 50-year-old filmmaker does best., Just when the film seems to have settled into that particular rubric, it sidesteps into a different bad-dream scenario... Which is where Side Effects starts getting slippery to a fault, and seriously problematic with it., It is, when the end credits roll, a sold, sturdy little mystery - sleek, and more than a little junk-foody., A chilling, disturbing portrait of the dangers of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the evil of deceit., Its difficult to escape the impression that the movie is impressed only with its cleverness., Side Effects is a more than worthy film for anyone to end their career (well, maybe) on., If audiences stop trying to unravel the very tangled plot and dont mind have the carpet pulled from under their feet again and again, they should find plenty here to relish., Once Side Effects gets into its crime story, medication is swept aside by movie nonsense. The storyline goes into tangles that have to be dealt with very rapidly if the audience is not to start laughing., If this puzzling, often very enjoyable medical thriller were directed by almost any film-maker other than Steven Soderbergh, you would be tempted to diagnose it with genre identity disorder., This movie is pure hokum, just as Hitchcocks great originals are, but you only realise this after - just like all the people in the film - you have been thoroughly hooked and duped yourself., A mischievously enthralling trip ..., What a gripping and disturbing thriller this is. Surely it cant be Soderberghs last movie. Say it aint so., Opts for raucous frivolity over genuine substance. But its great fun while it lasts., The instability bleeds into the fabric of the film itself, and until the very end, it is thrillingly hard to prise open its puzzle-box lid., As a thriller in the Hitchcock mould, Side Effects is great fun: its characters are well acted without being entirely likeable, which makes their jeopardy all the more enjoyable while putting us at a clinical remove., We may lose Soderbergh to painting, theatre and HBO-fuelled TV, and thats a crying shame. If thats the case, Side Effects is a great note on which to go out., Soderbergh is less interested in making statements than he is in skillfully fulfilling genre expectations., When alls said and done, itll go down as minor Soderbergh - clever sleight-of-hand, really - but it reminds you of so many Soderberghy virtues as to be an oddly compendious pleasure."
Rush ,0," Howard creates a persuasive sense of the time and place, and the race sequences are impressively mounted. This is thrillingly tense stuff, even if you know how the story panned out., While it has its moments of sentimentality, the film as a whole is rather shallow and fails to capture the soul of either man., This thrilling drama is no more for petrol-heads only than Titanic is solely of interest to historic ship enthusiasts., Rush is pure print the myth stuff -- but since both its heroes really are myths, it gets away with it, with more grace and vigor than you might expect., An entertaining movie with two solid performances that only occasionally stalls because of its sometimes heavy-handed treatment of Hunt and Laudas differences., Considering the subject matter, Rush delivers the expected visceral jolts; whats surprising is how endearing it is, even when its two protagonists are behaving like little more than boys with very fast toys., The script is another Peter Morgan special. Like, say, The Queen and Frost/Nixon, its a speculative duet built around a moment of newsworthiness., If you dont already know the story of that season, lucky you; even now, it exerts a ridiculous thrill., Rush is an outsize Hollywood spectacle about two outsize personalities in conflict, a sleekly assembled thrill machine that makes up in excitement for what it lacks in nuance., Rush is not a particularly deep film. But more importantly, it is not a film that mistakes itself for deep. And this self-knowledge makes Rush, in some ways, a wiser film than many that aspire to loftier goals., The British Hunt is Maverick to the Austrian Laudas Iceman, the Michael to his Sonny, the id to Laudas superego., Ron Howard has brought this story to life with unbridled energy, transforming each race into an adrenaline-charged vignette that could serve as a master class in staging and editing action scenes., Stripped-down characters and skeletal dramaturgy limit this movie about the real-life Formula 1 racing rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, but harrowing track scenes and an affecting second half provide some vivid compensation., This is a deeply adult drama, not least because Howard shows the costs of being so driven in a sport in which a driver is encased in a potential fireball., Rush may begin as a two-man race, but Brühls Lauda wins by a landslide., One thing\s for sure with this film: You carry the Rush out of the theater., Rush has an elemental simplicity about it. Two men in competition, driven (so to speak) to win. They are enemies. But they need each other, too, and as they roll around at 170 m.p.h., they come to understand why., Rush is the kind of Hollywood studio production that has sadly become all too rare - a smart, exciting, R-rated entertainment for grown-ups that quickens your pulse and puts on a great show., Rush ranks among the best movies about auto racing ever made, featuring two great performances from the leads., This is no mere thrill ride by two real-life rival speedsters, although it is certainly that. The film also provides a sobering look at what it takes to be a true champion."
Oz the Great and Powerful,0,"Make no mistake, Oz the Great & Powerful a beautiful film... But any true weight of vacancy rests in the script itself - and no feats of acting could have fundamentally changed this trap., With flying monkeys, Yellow Brick Road and sequin-spangled witches all faithfully reproduced, its impossible to see this as a standalone film, given it looks like an HD colouring book version of the original movie., The twister that comes to whirl Oscar into Oz is so preordained you could find its departure information and flight time from an airport travel board., This eye-filling fantasy is an entertaining riff on how the Wizard of that immortal film found his way to Oz., An imaginative mix of live-action and CGI that pays homage to the iconic images and timeless sense of wonder in the classic The Wizard of Oz without being too deferential., How refreshing it is to enjoy something we never knew we wanted., I was a bit skeptical about the casting of James Franco in this role, as a small-time carnival magician, but he is thoroughly engaging as a struggling con man and charmer., Oz the Great and Powerful is entirely serviceable family entertainment. Problem is, serviceable doesnt quite cut it when youre talking about the magical land of Oz., Aside from a trio of witches that can hold its own with Eastwicks in the dishiness department, Oz the Great and Powerful is a peculiarly joyless occasion., Let us take a moment to praise two great and surprisingly powerful characters: a winged monkey and a wee girl made out of china. Because so much human wonder resides in these two creations of make-up, puppetry, digital effects and lovely performances., The new Oz falls short of the 1939 Oz in charm and innocence, and certainly in songs. But as family entertainment, its hard to fault such a rapturous spectacle and astute, suspenseful piece of storytelling., Oz the Great and Powerful somehow manages to be both slavish to its hallowed template (when convenient) and completely tone-deaf to the magic that made it a one-of-a-kind cultural milestone., Raimis film is supposed to be about magic, but magic is in scant supply., The screenplay is not perky enough and Franco is miscast. Added to that, the three witches needed lessons from Macbeth to fully convince., Oz the Great and Powerful will likely dazzle family audiences while satisfying movie purists. Somewhere over the rainbow there may be a more magical movie, but this will certainly do., By the end of the two-hour 10-minute movie, director Sam Raimi proves he understands spectacle but not the deeper dreams of the people who consume it., A Blunder-full Blizzard of Blahs., Its a journey of self-discovery, rife with movie cliches about believing in yourself, believing in your dreams, yada-yada., The real star of the story is the enchanting, rapturously imagined setting., Oz the Great and Powerful aims for nostalgia in older viewers who grew up on The Wizard of Oz and still hold the classic dear while simultaneously enchanting a newer, younger audience. It never really accomplishes either successfully."
Delivery Man ,0,"A sentimental exploration of what fatherhood means that doesnt overdo it with the sperm gags, its a rather charming if unexceptional dramedy., The tone wavers between the pantomime and the mawkish and while little has been lost in translation, less still has been gained., Alas, the hero is played by Vince Vaughn, a limited actor whose range extends from petulant to homicidal., Vince Vaughn autopilots his way through this lame, contrived and strangely depressing high-concept comedy., A one-man show of ill-firing jokes, fizzling double takes and misty-eyed attempts at sentimental wrap-up., If you want something truly gruelling, try the new Vince Vaughn comedy., A golden comic premise, directed to dross by Ken Scott, who also made the Canadian original (Starbuck, from 2011) on which this Vince Vaughn vehicle is based., Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect., Unlike most Hollywood remakes of foreign-language pictures, Delivery Man was made by the same filmmaker responsible for the French-Canadian hit Starbuck., Calling Delivery Man a comedy is a bit of a stretch, because it\s rarely funny. Dumb, yes, but not in a way that\s worthy of more than a half-hearted chuckle., Even noting the toned-down performance of Vaughn and the films overall amiability, there are some creepy and unexplored issues lurking in the margins of this story that cant be brushed away., Delivery Man can be pegged as yet another in a seemingly endless series of Apatow-era man-child redemption stories ..., Starbuck was a funny and warm-hearted trifle. So is Delivery Man., Nothing quite seems to fit, as if the movies been assembled from bits and pieces of other movies., Delivery Man, with its democratic band of half-siblings and its feel-good view of humankind, is what it is: a reproductive remake that will make you laugh. More than once or twice., Its all far-fetched, silly and light. But then its supposed to be., Vince Vaughn can be a ray of sunshine in even the worst movies (see Be Cool for the best example of this). Here, I just didn\t buy him as a loveable sad-sack., Delivery Man is nowhere near the worst film of 2013, but it is definitely the most exhausting., Lets just say, whatever your mood going in, you will likely feel a good deal better coming out., A soggy comedy more focused on stimulating your tear ducts than your funny bone."
The Fifth Estate ,0,"Given its own aggressive attention deficit disorder, The Fifth Estate is the sort of movie that might induce a migraine., Those in the know say Cumberbatchs performance captures the physical Assange perfectly, but the film fails to get a handle on him as a personality, or offer any kind of insight into what his true motivation might be., Tthe film finally falls short, an explosive beginning leading to a pedestrian end., As nervy and as excitable as the trade that it depicts., The material covered in the production\s 128 minutes is not only inherently non-cinematic but not remotely thrilling, at least in the conventional sense., The bullet points of WikiLeaks rise and fall are dutifully covered, but the movie bites off more than it can chew..., The Fifth Estate is also as current as a news feed, filling in the disputed facts about Assanges life beyond the headlines and chronicling the revolution that has upended the media landscape in the last decade., Director Bill Condon delivers an intelligent, dynamic, character-centered drama., Condon and his screenwriter Josh Singer dont quite know what to make of this duo, perhaps because the men didnt quite know what to make of each other, either., The Fifth Estate feels unfortunately small and safe., A feeble, reactionary drama., The Fifth Estate tries to be a cross between The Social Network and Zero Dark Thirty. Only it\s more like The Sociopath Network meets Zero Dumb Thirty., It may be a bit chilly, but The Fifth Estate is good, scary information well-processed., The problem with director Bill Condons fictionalized account of all this is that, like WikiLeaks itself, theres way too much data to sift through., The Fifth Estate takes on the important 21st century question of information flow vs. privacy rights and fumbles it into a middling mishmash of techno thriller and future-of-journalism lecture., Like the journalists Assange worked with, it tries to put some shape and perspective on a story that is still too big and too new to frame as a definitive narrative., The first narrative film portrait of the white-blond cyber bad boy feels undercooked and overwrought, haphazardly written and overdirected., Benedict Cumberbatch restores mystery to the personality of WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and fascination to his role as a global crusader for free speech., As much it claims urgency with current events and issues, it seems out of date, even coming just three years after the real events., The movie cant quite decide what it thinks of Assange - or even if it should decide at all."
Clear History,0,"The high points - especially a brilliantly worked running gag about soft-rockers Chicago - are spread too thinly, and Davids improvised comedy of embarrassment is now very familiar., The revenge plot brings the characters together...and doesn\t come together as satisfyingly as your average Curb episode... but the funny parts of Clear History are good enough to act as an acceptable 100-minute substitute., For those of us who agree with Mel Brooks that there\s something about this middle-aged bald guy that\s thrilling, his new film is a high-spirited treat - and a hint at the possibilities that await him if and when he finally calls it a day on \Curb.\, It will take only a few minutes of Clear History... not only to forgive David for repeating himself but to thank him for reminding us why we miss Curb Your Enthusiasm and hope it comes back soon., It has a nice, confident and well-edited breeze to it (including a lot of jokes about the band Chicago), with a fun cast that includes standout riffs from Michael Keaton, Danny McBride and Eva Mendes., A wonderfully diverting film with Mr. David at his abrasive best., If youre a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm, think of this as an extended version of Curb. If youre not, History will not convert you., Clear History was improvised from 35 pages of script. You are such an a---! one Vineyard resident tells Flomm, which is the movie\s main revelation., Clear History, a memorable comedy about a man trying to be forgotten., Even if you do like Davids shtick, as I do, you have no business here., Clear History is amusing enough to pull a viewer through it, although those who havent yet acquired a taste for Curb might find it the equivalent of a pricey two-drink minimum without enough payback., The movie also feels at time like an extended all-star jam episode of Curb. Those are, perhaps not coincidentally, the best, and funniest parts of Clear History., As the movie proceeds, it gains traction, first as a kind of pleasant alt-Woody Allen vehicle... and then as a well-modulated morality play., Despite a number of funny lines sprinkled through the script, this History isnt very memorable., Its hard to fault HBO for letting him indulge in this flight of fancy, particularly given all the marquee names he attracts. Still, without an ability to focus those appetites, Clear History yields the occasional chuckle, but somewhat curbed enthusiasm., Clear History is so funny it made me want to order up some Palestinian chicken."
Monsters University,0,"It is essentially Revenge of the Nerds, with fur. And scales. And whatever gooey, gelatinous substance comprises the outer coating of various other oddball creatures in this crazy parallel world., Studios dont often seem to be thinking about the ideal moviegoer, just about the maximum number of moviegoers ... Pixar is no different in that regard, but even in this relatively fallow period ... its never stopped thinking the most of us., So many movies, these days, are about nerds and their market value. Dan Scanlons prequel is the newest, but already feels old., Its a strong look at the genesis of a satisfying partnership, but it could be stronger if it trusted that partnership to carry the story., It is funny. But the longed-for return to Pixar greatness seems as far away as ever., After an hour it starts to feel like Harry Potter gone wacky and gonzo - and not quite wacky and gonzo enough., Its not that Monsters University lacks any of the heart or wit of Pixars finest achievements - the attention to detail and sight gags are as impressive as ever - but narratively speaking this is derivative in the extreme., The story is so fully and elegantly realised that to call it a prequel would somehow feel like an insult., It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, thats a result., Dazzlingly clever and hugely funny, it succeeds both as a broadening of the Monsters universe and as a film in its own right., This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets., As prequels go, Monsters University is pretty nifty., Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, its nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids., It is true to the spirit of the original film, Monsters Inc., and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground., ...I can applaud a story that not only celebrates oddballs and underdogs but shows how young outcasts can find their way in the world..., Its not like Monsters University is a bad movie. Its just not a terribly interesting one., A charming, well-crafted trifle - at least until the subversive last act, when it sets its sights a bit higher., It conforms to Pixars apparent drift toward the average, with toy sales taking priority over originality., \Monsters University is an imaginative, raucous, wildly inventive cartoon of a movie., What hasnt advanced is the plotting, which was nothing special last time and is so formulaic now that its basically surprise-free."
4 Minute Mile,0,"A by-the-numbers tale of inspiration through perspiration., 4 Minute Mile at least has the decency to acknowledge that its aware of its underdog sports-movie clichs, especially the ones that made The Karate Kid such an 80s classic., More than one interior scene looks underlit for effect,but thats at least something else to think about as the film goes through its paces., Its a moving, if occasionally heavy-handed, sports drama that deserves a wider audience than it is probably going to find in its limited release., A finely written and directed sports drama with a lead performance by rising star Kelly Blatz so deep and affecting it often evokes Timothy Hutton\s Oscar-winning turn in Ordinary People., Theres a similar redolence to 4 Minute Mile overall-the odor of a hard-working but underachieving movie thats 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration., A sympathetic performance by Richard Jenkins does little to dispel the stale atmosphere here, 4 Minute Mile is cobbled together with every sports underdog clich imaginable."
Inherent Vice ,0,"If Im going fawn over a puzzling film, Id rather it be something like Inception or The Matrix, movies that entertain me but also provoke so much thought and analysis that I cant take my mind off it., If the adaptations a little too faithful to sustain a cinematically tight story, theres still a lot to admire in the sheer, uninhibited folly of the whole thing, the gall to get groovy while the Oscar-watchers are on high alert., After a decade spent making two films that are like pressure cookers, Anderson was clearly ready to blow off some steam., It isnt one film but many, an anthology of expertly recreated genre tropes, from fog-shrouded noir to sunlit paranoia., I found myself going with it for about two thirds of the time, seduced by its sweetness, suspicious of its sexuality ... occasionally exasperated by its incessant shaggy-doggedness., The thing Inherent Vice has going is its sense of always plucking at the fringe, the conviction that the central characters arent necessarily the most interesting ones., I think I need to see it again, again., Watching Paul Thomas Andersons wonderfully textured and intricate LA-set Inherent Vice, you are easily reminded of the famous story about Howard Hawks version of The Big Sleep., Not knowing quite where the joke is doesnt stop us from finding it funny, any more than confusion should preclude our wistful appreciation., Paul Thomas Andersons Inherent Vice provides a rush of pure hallucinogenic pleasure, but its logic is mighty hard to follow., The less you try to figure out Andersons rambling, mesmerising mystery, the better. Just relax and let this beautiful, haunting, hilarious, chaotic, irritating and possibly profound tragicomedy wash over you., As rich and strange as we\ve come to expect from the late Anderson films, but doesn\t quite achieve the digressive whackadoo majesty of the novel., A delirious triumph: a stylish-squared meeting of creative minds, a swirl of hypnosis and symbiosis, with Pynchons prose partly assigned to a narrating character and partly diversified into funky dialogue exchanges., How will this play in the non-Pynchon community? Not at all, sez us. But for the converted or the plain curious, its something to see, if not cherish., Anderson moves further from conventional storytelling with each new film, and closer to something more intuitive, more damning, more true. He hasnt made it there yet. God help us when he does., Some storylines conclude, some collide, others dissipate. But the films main crime is this: Its boring., Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as the perpetually befuddled Doc, a private detective of sorts who immerses himself in pot in the Los Angeles of 1970., Although its not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasnt read Pynchons novel., Inherent Vice is a sun-glared, neon-limned muddle of noir plotline and potheaded jokery that not only doesnt make sense, but actually seems to try hard not to., Andersons impeccable casting and music choices are captivating, and there is an amusing contrast between his attention to every detail and the convoluted storyline."
X-Men: Days of Future Past,0,"It is especially impressive that Days of Future Past is a success; a film this gooey and complex, with such business-minded scope, should not feel like a real movie at all., In an age when more and more movies just feel like stepping-stones toward the next, bigger things, is it so much to ask that it be a good movie all on its own?, I guess I am a sucker for these sort of time travel films, travelling back in time to change the course of history., It trots along at a fair old pace, the cast doing a sterling job of keeping straight faces while spouting quasi-scientific gobbledegook., Heres the thing about comic book heroes. Despite all the noble talk about metaphors, idealism, truth and justice, theyre basically just bully-boy fantasies of limitless male aggression... The X-Men, however, have always aspired to something different., X-Men: Days Of Future Past is vibrant and entertaining., Those with wistful memories of the 1970s will find plenty to like in X-Men: Days of Future Past., Much of this takes place in the early 1970s, which gives the filmmakers an excuse to haul out lots of vintage kitsch and make some rather tasteless references to the Vietnam war., The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny., I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film., Sentinels, good, bad, future, past, who cares? This movie needs more Quicksilver!, Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this pictures new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink., Just solid fan service. Good action, decent actors, and a chance to see them all in action doesnt pardon the convoluted glut of messy time-travel exposition., A pleasingly coherent, plot-driven action movie, positively streamlined by the standards of todays superhero blockbusters., The plot is about a fearful society whose expansion of its security apparatus has unintended consequences, but Singer doesnt even touch the storys topical resonances... Theres also no real moral quandary to be grappled with., Perhaps more than any other superhero franchise, X-Men captures the overlapping fantasies of being unique yet not alone, and of being a hero but also being saved., To ensure long-term survival, this franchise needs to evolve. In terms of the competition, however, its still light years ahead., Having already directed the first two (and superior) X-Men films, Singer shows a level of comfort with both the material and the cast ..., Singer is reborn - deft, elegant, spring-heeled - in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The special effects dont bog him down: They lift the movie to a surreal and more emotional dimension., The fireworks, the super-power circus, lots of surprise cameos and Big Moments - X-Men: Days of Future Past has them all. Logic? Who cares?"
Barefoot ,0,"The gradual revelation that theres more to Daisy than meets the eye is no great surprise, but it does at least negate - too late! - some of the more troubling subtext., Its all thoroughly, intentionally lightweight, and the films final 10 minutes is a rush of highly unlikely smiley face resolutions. Still, Wood somehow makes it work as well as it can., Hes a rebellious trust-funder who specializes in strip clubs, one-night stands and gambling debts. Shes a possibly schizophrenic mental patient raised in near-captivity by an abusive mother. How could these two kids not fall in love?, Scott Speedman and Evan Rachel Wood would have been better off doing a YouTube video together where they simply make goo-goo eyes at one another than co-starring in a featherweight trifle like Barefoot., A sorry throwback to sentimental 1960s movies -- the ones in which an offbeat woman repairs the soul of an emotionally clueless man., The movie acts like screwball comedy, but there are no laughs as Daisy and Jays connection lurches toward implausible romance., Out of the mouths of babes comes dribble, as often as wisdom-or, in the case of this movies infantile heroine, drivel., This ill-advised romance from director Andrew Fleming is the sort of indie lark that nearly drowns in its own whimsy. Wade in at your own risk., Barefoot has the distinction of featuring what has to be the only female character no actress of any pedigree could ever make believable., Barefoot plays its romance straight and glossy, trying to pass off serious mental illness as a cutesy character quirk that needs only the balm of true love to resolve itself., A return to the cinema of adorable mental illness - something that, like the killer in a slasher movie, always seems to lurch back to life just when you think its safely dead ..."
Tusk ,0,"Tusk opens with the sound of two men laughing at their own jokes, so I guess a doff of the cap is due to the filmmaker for encapsulating his movie so efficiently, right from the jump., Justin Long and Johnny Depp join the Clerks director for a weird, unpredictable movie that still feels like only Smith could have made it., Parts of it are funny, parts are suspenseful and parts of it - to put it mildly - are hideously awful. Horrible may be a better word than horrific., Nice as it would be to herald Tusk as a return to Smiths bold early period, the movie has a lurching tone and an airless atmosphere., Smith has always had a weakness for protracted dialogue, and in Parks he has a fitting muse., I thought this was a really pointless exercise., If Kevin Smith was stoned when he thought up his excellent walrusian nightmare, then marijuana is the best creative medicine., Excess is Smith\s middle name, so the show goes on . . . and on., Tusk is not a particularly good movie, but the vivid anxiety dream at its heart makes it one of the most personal films this writer-director has ever made., Tusk is an overextended, tonally incoherent joke that would make viewers squirm even if it didnt involve a bloody and demented medical experiment., If youre a Kevin Smith junkie, as I am, youll appreciate the verbal pinwheels he spins around the horror genre in Tusk., Had Smith been more disciplined, the films deliberately absurd plot twists might have been more alienating, and funny., A schizoid horror comedy with an identity crisis, shifting uncomfortably between shocking body horror and puerile Jackass-level cringe humor., The screenplay feels like a series of tweets. And the appearance of a big star in a wink-at-the-audience disguise is a distracting stunt., This tonal mishmash is a misfire of literally gross proportions., Smith seems to have been more charged up by the (profoundly ridiculous) ideas behind his movie than in making them work., Kevin Smith, of Clerks, delivers a weird in-joke inspired by one of his podcasts. You probably had to be there., You can imagine Mr. Smith and his collaborators rolling in the aisles at their own preposterousness. If you can find your inner 16-year-old, you might just join them., Take The Human Centipede and sprinkle liberally with the old Bob and Doug McKenzie sketches from SCTV and the result is Tusk, Kevin Smiths underbaked horror-comedy hybrid., It has a game cast, its watchable, fun, sick, sad and has to be seen to be believed."
Someone Marry Barry,0,"The way the film hews to tiresome conventions is itself a buzzkill, but worse is its sheer lack of energy., Theres nothing sophisticated or groundbreaking here, but the movie is a moderately good entry in the bro-grows-up genre., Various catastrophes ensue, although hilarity does not."
Hellion ,0,"Despair is not quiet for a broken father (Aaron Paul) and his troublemaker sons in Kat Candlers brisk, transfixing drama, which takes place in blue-collar southeast Texas., Hellion pads its slender, commonplace, but potentially rewarding premise with contrivances, clichs, repetitiousness, and, when all else fails, implausible, arbitrary melodrama., Not that inarticulate characters can\t be compelling if they are written with subtlety, acted with insight and, most of all, framed by a directorial vision, but Hellion, despite a promising debut from Wiggins, falls short in at least two of the above., The acting overall is strong, but Paul, still testing the waters after Breaking Bad, is extraordinarily controlled., The relief youll experience during the beautifully modulated ending to Hellion may elicit a heavy sigh, deep and gratifying., The hellion of Hellion is Jacob Wilson, a 13-year-old Texas rebel with a cause. As played by a real teenager, Josh Wiggins, he\s a force of nature., Though it may seem as if its heading in the direction of being a feel-good movie Hellion doesnt go down that predictable road. It is more authentic than that, and that is indeed something to feel good about., If only Candler had trusted her characters enough to carry the story without the need for the requisite Act One gun and Act Three firing of same, Hellion would stand out more amidst an ever-growing pack of similar films., Hellion offers a startling and memorable portrait of adolescent life in downscale East Texas suburbia, along with a white-hot breakthrough performance from teenage actor Josh Wiggins., Hellion is a well-observed and patiently told story, with one good scene after another, featuring amazing performances across the board, but particularly from newcomer Josh Wiggins., The whole film seems to be running in place., Candler insistently tightens her focus on the hardships of growing up in a broken family, an approach that eventually feels over-determined., An affecting rural Southern drama about a delinquent teens descent into misery and mayhem that distinguishes itself from the indie pack through precise direction and superb lead performances by Aaron Paul and newcomer Josh Wiggins., Though some characters go underdeveloped, Hellion marks one of Hollywoods most realistic examinations of rural high school angst since Friday Night Lights, another teen drama set in Texas., A glimpse into rural American childhood thats both tense and melancholy., The movie falls into an all too familiar indie torpor., Features a fair share of forced drama ..., Hellion lingers for most of its running time in a betwixt-and-between place, never becoming either the sublime character sketch or the overripe melodrama it alternately promises to be., Hellion offers Paul his most adult screen role so far, and hes very fine, but the movie belongs to Wiggins, a newcomer whose innate gifts are a perfect echo of Pauls., Texas-based helmer Kat Candler unpacks the inner turmoil behind acts of trespassing, vandalism and spontaneous aggression that threaten to send young Jacob down the wrong path in life."
Maggie ,0,"Maggie could have been a rare treat... Instead, what we get is a genuinely new take that winds up feeling, somehow, like the same old stuff weve seen a million times before., Its a serious, heartfelt, dramatic turn, and he totally nails it. Im as surprised as you are., Breslin is affecting as the ordinary young woman beneath the festering flesh, while Arnie shows a delicacy youd never have suspected, at least not from his current TV ads with meerkats., A missed opportunity., A quietly melancholic study of a father-daughter relationship playing out under the shadow of her terminal disease., It feels a little like a very special episode of The Walking Dead and might be a tad low-key for its field, but Schwarzenegger and Breslin are good and the payoff is affecting., The film ladles on the melancholy so thickly that theres no space for you to feel it for yourself., One interminably boring and mawkish film, overlaid with YA-dystopian self-pity., Most of Maggie is so dark you can barely make out the zombies or the humans. It also moves more slowly than the ghouls., I feel some guilt in giving a film that tries this hard a negative review. But I couldnt shake my sense of aggravation at how it all plays out, especially in Schwarzeneggers case., Ultimately, neither the brain-eating genre or the heart-breaking one is enhanced by this mash-up. Like Celine Dion\s cover of AC/DC\s You Shook Me All Night Long, file it under the category of interesting-but-why?, The problem, aside from not much going on, is that Schwarzenegger remains a severely limited actor, so theres not that much character to study. Potentially interesting concept; wrong star., Its creepy atmosphere aside, Maggie is a slog of the living dead., Its a sad story, or would be if the zombie apocalypse backdrop - and the inky splotches creeping across Maggies body - didnt wreak such havoc with the movies unsmiling sincerity., The plot is lean, the dialogue is spare and there are some intriguing stabs at intellectual and emotional terrain. But the pacing is deadly, so slow there might be time for a catnap or two without missing anything important., The performances in Maggie are strong. The camera is often right up in the characters faces, putting Schwarzeneggers lived-in, world-weary mug to good use and telegraphing Breslins vulnerability., An art film. About zombies. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger., The sight of Schwarzenegger in this small, subdued role makes us root for his survival. Thats the power of star wattage at work. Not even the undead can kill it., Casting Schwarzenegger is such an eyebrow-raising choice that the film seemed destined to be something different. So the fact that it emerges as a sleepy, half-formed thing is disappointing ..., If only freshman director Henry Hobson was even more committed to his intriguing strategy for showcasing his unlikely star, and kept things quiet throughout."
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,0,"The live-action sequences, in which Antonio Banderas chews the pirate scenery, may not live up to the Looney Tunes madness of the cartoons, but for sheer head-scrambling craziness this is hard to beat., Intermittently, SpongeBobs latest feature is very funny indeed, even for non-devotees of the original series., Sponge Out of Water has a frenetic, Looney Tunes pacing and a head-spinning, surreal story that makes you wonder whether its aimed at children or stoners., Almost every line is a zinger, which can be appreciated in a state of total sobriety: its a non-stoner stoner film - and very funny., The film moves like a pyjama case full of angry weasels, and finds ingenious ways to cram every scene with just one more loopy, disposable gag or slapstick thwack. It may not be the years best animated film, but its almost certainly the most., Its a simple premise with proven appeal, giving director Paul Tibbitt and his team freedom to construct a film where just about every element of the storytelling exists to be parodied and undermined., I never know what I want from commercial animated entertainment, but I do know that I like being able to suspect that -- by the standards of the competition -- its makers might be outlaws and lunatics., Its tough to hold a lack of narrative ambition against any toon so eager to lob bit after bit of psychedelic surrealism at its audience, be they wee tykes or stoned adults., Business as usual for the irrepressibly cheerful, pineapple-dwelling sea-creature., Its big, loud, choppy, in-your-face, and absolutely, positively glorious., Not the most gripping narrative, but the frenetic pace and nonstop gags will please young fans., The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water remains true to the surrealism of its animated television roots. But it also tries to force a live-action element which isn\t as comfortable a fit as a certain pair of symmetrical trousers., The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water mostly nails what has always made the character, and his brightly coloured underwater world, so endearing: the abundant innocence, the welcome lack of cynicism and the out-and-out stupidity., While less fluid and fresh than its 2004 predecessor, the new film displays enough nutty writing and sheer brio to confirm the stamina of its enduring and skillfully voiced characters., Deliriously silly story, tender-hearted and cheery., For my part, its the most laughs Ive had at a theatre this year., The bulk of Sponge Out of Water stays submerged, hand-drawn and Banderas-free, still delivering the coy wit, surrealism and absurdity that come hand-in-hand with SpongeBobs frivolous, childish whimsy., All of the strangely charming cartoony undersea nonsense of SpongeBob that\s delighted kids and stoners for year comes to the surface in The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. Prepare to giggle., Maybe we shouldn\t have expected too much from The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water., A goofy gag-filled surf-and-turf romp that will entertain adults with its ridiculous lunacy as it delights kids with colourful fun."
The Good Dinosaur,0,"The Good Dinosaur is a childrens fable that is more than content to be exactly what it is and little more., The script is puzzlingly devoid of wit, the conflicts and character arcs are unimaginative and stale, the pacing is inexorable, and the plotting is rudimentary at best., The Good Dinosaur is a much better film than Cars but the newer movies propensity for sentimentality and Americana does indeed recall the earlier, unlovely Pixar adventure., What does stand out is the animation, especially the realistic depiction of flowing rivers, raging storms, placid lagoons, geysers and thermal pools. And the Apatosaurus are cute too., Very good indeed., If The Good Dinosaur falls low in the rankings of the companys now 16 titles, it is still leagues finer than the flurry of frenetic colors and screwball pacing of the standard childrens animated movie., The Good Dinosaur is the animation behemoth Pixar at its most formulaic and uninspired., Written by Meg LeFauve, with her, Sohn, and others credited on story, The Good Dinosaur features the most mundane narrative of any Pixar film-mundane because it so blatantly aspires to mythic resonance., However much it may delight on a scene-by-scene basis, The Good Dinosaur never comes together as a coherent whole, a crucial flaw for a film by Pixar, which has always put story first., The Good Dinosaur is by no means a bad movie. But it breaks new ground for Pixar in that its the studios first feature that is explicitly-and pretty much exclusively-a kids movie., Even the look of The Good Dinosaurs main character seems outdated, blocky, and out of place in his own world., The digital landscapes are meant to be breathtakingly beautiful, but they tend to come across more like very expensive screensavers or immersive desktop wallpapers., I found it desperately disappointing, unoriginal and twee ..., If The Good Dinosaur falls short in the narrative department, it represents a step forward for Pixars artists., OK, its not pushing the boundaries of storytelling, but it certainly does the job., The characters may look cartoony-and cloyingly cute-but theyre wandering through what could be Thomas Hill paintings in panoramic widescreen., As Pixar productions go, this one isnt a groundbreaker, but its heartfelt and endearing, as well as visually splendiferous, and kids will love it for sure., The resulting film is amiable, pretty, and charming in all the right ways -- even if it ultimately settles for a fairly typical tale of a late bloomer finding his way., The intricately designed settings convey a Miyazaki-like reverence for the natural world, and the heros longing for his family is affecting, never saccharine., Perfect holiday treat for the kids with great characters and majestically rendered landscapes."
Elvis & Nixon,0,"One ends up wishing for more Nixon and less Elvis, which is not something many people said at the time., Elvis and Nixon are fascinating - if only we were allowed to spend more time with them., Its entertaining fluff and, frankly, Thats All Right., Like an anti-Frost/Nixon, theres a ton of build up and no pay-off., A very likeable movie and one that you warm to in spite of its lack of substance... and of Elvis music., Theres not a lot of consequence to this bizarre meeting, or really the film, but as a character study of two men alone at the top, its both very funny and quietly astute., Perhaps this meeting of suspicious minds really was an unsung crux of modern American history, but Elvis & Nixon feels like a trifle about a trifle., Elvis & Nixon is a diverting portrait of two great alpha dogs at bay, beginning to feel themselves slide., A bolder film might have played up the absurdity and surrealism of the situation or given some gripping historical context for all this. As it is, there isnt much to get all shook up about., The spectacle of Presley visiting Nixons buttoned-down White House in his jeweled sunglasses, silk scarf, open shirt, and giant gold belt is inherently farcical, but Elvis & Nixon might have delivered more than dumb laughs., A free-wheeling good-time Charlie of a movie, detailing the strange circumstances by which Presley and the President met one December afternoon in 1970., Its a bright snapshot, a toothless but amiable comedy anchored by two chunky bits of acting., The dialogue sparkles with gems of historical allusion and perceptive asides, and the actors virtually sing it; the film plays like a whirling sociopolitical operetta., It is a joyful and imaginative exploration of a historical enigma., As a surreal slice of history served up nearly half a century later, it feels oddly satisfying: A reminder not just of simpler times, but of all the other wild untold stories we may never know, just because no camera was there to capture them., What the movie, directed by Liza Johnson, lacks in factual material it replaces with whimsy and quirky humour, helped greatly by the casting of Michael Shannon as Presley and Kevin Spacey as Nixon., Elvis & Nixon is at its best when it sticks to what-if whimsy and the enjoyable fantasy of worlds colliding, with all the outlandish possibilities that crossover stories suggest., A sharper movie would have pushed this bizarre incident into psychological rawness, revealing a shared sense of paranoia. Breezy, comic and disposable, Elvis & Nixon is not that film., Even when I didnt buy a word being said, I went with the flow. Why? Michael Shannon as Elvis and Kevin Spacey as Tricky Dick. Watching great actors swing for the fences is something special., Given the high quotient of hypotheticals in the story line, Nixon & Elvis cant really be said to add to the historical record, but its an entertaining, deadpan jape that, with a bit of tweaking, could probably work as a stage play."
The Love Witch,0,"A hilarious and pointed examination of sexuality through meticulous retro pastiche with some highly entertaining performances, The Love Witch revels in its blend of thoughtfulness with B-movie camp., A side-swiping original that deserves its inevitable cult status., The film offers a brilliant spin on the genres despicable gender politics, all the while relishing in the pleasures of its outmoded visual style., Even if the climax doesnt quite have the kick we might hope for, cult status surely awaits this bewitching oddity., A note-perfect parody of the British Technicolor horror films of the Sixties., The Love Witch goes beyond camp, beyond pastiche; it ignites the pulpy surfaces of its tale and produces a smoke of bad-dream sexiness and scariness. Its a B-movie with A-grade potency., The mix of am-dram solemnity, grand guignol and Terpsichorean time-tripping is hypnotic., Even in the films most far-fetched moments, Biller has trenchant points to make about conservative, middle-class Americas fear of female sexuality and the double standards that apply to men and womens romantic behaviour., A genre-stretching horror melodrama crafted with extraordinary detail and style. A touch languid, its also mesmerising, provocative, unsettling and sensual., This is not a potion fit for everyone, but for a select few, The Love Witch offers powerful magic., A modern feminist horror tale that rewards deep exploration beneath its admittedly beautiful surface. What looks like it might be simply a pure exercise in style not only invites multiple viewings, it requires them., Theres nothing like The Love Witch, and thats a good thing, for if there were, I seriously doubt Id be as captivated with this marvelous bit of murderous whimsy as I most assuredly am., Billers visual splendor is ... wasted on a mediocre script riddled with structural problems. Scenes follow another willy-nilly, as if moved around late in the process., Its like a Bewitched episode stretched out to two hours. But boy, is it gorgeous to look at., Is the Love Witch a parody? It sure feels like it. But I\m not sure Biller intended it to be one., Its a lot of fun., While The Love Witch leans heavily on its inspirations, it isnt like anything youve seen before., The fear of female sexuality has been a staple of horror movies forever, but The Love Witch does more than simply subvert or parody the erotic underpinnings of the genre., As with giallo, The Love Witch features deliberately wooden acting, and can be a little boring at times. But it\s a stunningly photographed, fascinating reinterpretation of classic melodrama., Its cloaked in a retro wardrobe and soundtrack (much of the music, by Italys Ennio Morricone, is sourced from 60s thrillers) but loaded with irony and a fluid sense of identity."
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,0,"The emotional component is cheapened, at least partially, inserting a level of bad taste into the proceedings I found difficult to get past., Makes American Sniper look positively pacifist by comparison., Punishingly paced, flimsily constructed, and tackily executed, with the subtlety and panache of a third-rate 1930s melodrama., If you are looking for an immersive action thriller, this will do the trick., Bay certainly has a style of his own, albeit one that again harks back to the 1980s -- an even more cartoonish variant on the music-video bombast pioneered by directors such as Tony Scott., Unsurprisingly, survivors of the incidents depicted have dismissed the film as utter nonsense. Even if this were not the case, the film-makers have some explaining to do to the military folks Bay presumably seeks to honour., I went into the film knowing almost nothing about the September 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya and came out knowing even less., 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a movie for anyone who saw The Hurt Locker and thought, You know what would make this really good? If they got six really muscley dudes with machineguns to come in and blow away all the Arabs., Its undeniably spectacular in its own juddering, pyrotechnical, Armageddon-ish fashion, but its also a film that leads a very rancid taste., The title should give you some idea of how long this two-and-a-half hour film really feels., Once you get past the suspicion that hes going to glance wearily into the camera at any moment, Krasinski is highly believable as the semi-reluctant combatant in a battle that looks impossible to win., Everything youd expect from Bay is here with bells on - the macho provocation, the sound and fury, and the diabolical pleasure in reducing everything to rubble and bloody mush., Its all so hateful. Hates women. Hates talking. Hates tact. Loves guns., The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully, that artist will possess at least half of Bays punishing, peerless craft., The movie is imperfect and overlong but its never boring. And, although aspects of its factual accuracy can be called into question, it does a decent job of chronicling what happened that night., Several critics have given 13 Hours a pass, citing Bays skill at action engineering. Its his failure at everything else that makes this movie as hard to endure as it is impossible to believe. #helpme, Bay does well here what he always does well: He keeps the action at full throttle. This is also what he does so annoyingly: He always keeps things at full throttle., Bay is hell on manly banter amid the explosions (Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi), and also moments carefully calculated to make you feel the horrors - and the heroics - of war. Emphasis on calculated., Bay\s action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever, but his reductive worldview is also on display. 13 Hours doesn\t just lionize its American soldiers, it oozes disdain for everyone else., 13 Hours presents itself as a straightforward war film, but thats the last thing a subject this complex needed."
Jane Got a Gun,0,"What is here is enjoyable if taken on its own terms, much of Jane Got a Gun playing out with a 1940s or 50s Hollywood lan I found more than satisfying., Is it possible that Natalie Portman cant act?, Theres hardly a scene you watch without wondering, and doubting, if Ramsay would have done it quite this way., Its all perfectly passable, but rather perfunctory ..., This was a troubled production. Scottish director Lynne Ramsay quit days before shooting began and there were late changes made to the cast. In certain respects, the replacement director Gavin OConnor has done an impressive job., A very moderate adventure., OConnor once again proves that he can mine femininity just as effectively as he explored masculinity in Pride and Glory (2008) and Warrior (2011)., Jane Got a Gun is being sold as a rousing feminist Western although the truth is that its about as rousing and feminist as my cat, Daphne, who is 17, and now barely moves., Feels as though everyone involved forced themselves to grit their teeth and get on with it., You have to feel a certain sympathy for a project as cursed as this one, but theres no denying that Janes gun barely grazes its target., OConnors movie is too sentimental and self-serious to add much of note to the mythos, but Portman embodies her characters grief no less movingly than her forebears., It constantly blunders into stylistic choices and narrative clichs that sabotage the sturdy two-hander at its center., The movie isnt terrible, so it cant qualify as a hate-watch. Its just dull., At times, Jane Got A Gun comes perilously close to staying passive-to becoming A Gun Was Gotten By Jane., As stripped-down, revisionist Westerns go, Jane Got A Gun may not have reinvented the wagon wheel, but it rolls out as a sturdy, well-crafted genre piece despite its rocky road to the screen., Whatever feminist angle the film might have once aspired to is lost in its listless shuffle., A Western with potential for feminist table-turning and old-fashioned violence, Jane Got a Gun is a major letdown. Despite being co-produced by Portman, the movie sells her character short at nearly every turn., The Weinstein Company may have unloaded this embattled Western without fanfare, but it should still appeal to genre fans., This scandal-plagued project overcame the odds to deliver an earnestly felt actioner. ... Thankfully, it isn\t another historically revisionist, grim-dark bleak-a-thon like, say, The Revenant and The Hateful Eight., Jane Got a Gun is a slow fuse of a film that burns to a whimper instead of an explosion."
Bleed for This,0,"Teller is appreciably committed to the character, but hes only given one note to play, his full-bodied passion wasted on a movie that would rather win on points than go for the knockout., Younger jacks up the action in the last third, but the air goes out of a fight movie when you can see the next jab coming., Bleed for This is still worth seeing, despite its familiar trappings., Bleed For This is twelve rounds of tedium, a boring boxing movie that draws most of its strength from memories of other, better experiences., A solid, but unremarkable drama., No flatfoot, no knockout, writer-director Ben Younger\s Bleed for This wins on points., The glove drama grand guignol comes straight from grandmas kitchen -- hot-chestnut hokum, sizzling clichés., Although its debatable whether we need another boxing movie, or whether there is anything new that can be added to an overcrowded genre, this serviceable true-life comeback story has a couple of things in its favour., There is... something intriguing in Younger and Tellers understanding of the films hero. An all-round addict who frequents sleazy strip clubs and gambling dens, Vinnys rage against impossible odds is both admirable and utterly crazed., The worst thing about boxing films is the boxing... Bleed for This, thankfully, knows these pitfalls., Middleweight, non-intelligence-insulting fare right to the core, Bleed For This keeps you squarely in your seat, but barely once excites you enough to leap up out of it., It never questions or qualifies its upbeat message, but it\s watchable, well-crafted stuff, strongly acted, with a very funny opening weigh-in sequence, as Vinny desperately tries to sweat off excess pounds with minutes to go., It may be predictable, but Bleed For This still grabs with its astonishing against-all-odds true story, and its belter of a central performance from Miles Teller., Bleed For This is an enjoyable but very generic and old-fashioned boxing movie., A journeyman effort thats satisfyingly light on melodrama., Ben Youngers Bleed for This, starring Miles Teller, distinguishes itself by doubling down on some of the tried-and-true formulas. Its a comeback times two., Bleed for This is utterly devoid of tension, making for a limp entry in the fighting-film lineage., Bleed for This will not be the drama that establishes Teller as a heavyweight in Hollywood. And thats a real shame for its true champ, Aaron Eckhart., Theres always another fight, just as theres always another boxing film., Teller is magnetic in the lead role, and he helps Bleed for This transcend boxing movie clichés."
Barbershop: The Next Cut,0,"This one, thankfully, boasts some welcome new cast members (including the rapper Common and Nicki Minaj), a new director in Malcolm D Lee (the cousin of Spike), and a fearless approach to difficult subjects., Barbershop: The Next Cut brings topical social issues into the narrative but only starts meaningful conversations without genuinely pushing them forward., What most captivates is the rhythm of those scenes in which the characters mount the soapbox to share stinging observations on a variety of topics in an often hilarious back-and-forth battle of words., The fourth entry in the Barbershop franchise delivers keen social commentary, bringing back many of the key players from the 2002 and 2004 installments., Leaving aside the humorous cultural escapism of the early aughts, The Next Cut faces the racial and political issues of 2016 head on., This Barbershop is simply a place where we can all laugh together, sometimes at ideas that veer close to being explosive., Its refreshing to encounter a sequel that leans deeper into sociopolitical realities, not further away., The movie deals tangentially with #BlackLivesMatter but what its really about is the space: a place where a community can get together to share their anger, pain, faults and joys. That matters too. Thats what these movies are., What makes it work is the talk, the constant banter that sways in and out of heartfelt discussion of all the big issues: race, gender, politics, community, family, and love., Its stagey, often simplistic and it talks too damn much. But, hell, the talk has flavor and snap and a real-world sense of a community in crisis. Not bad for an escapist romp., Next time? Just a little off the top please, and leave the socio-political commentary to others., The cast has a natural chemistry and the shop has an authentic feel. Even as things get preachy, the quips keep customers coming through the door., Instead of offering easy answers, Barbershop: The Next Cut raises important, difficult, and timely questions., The Next Cut manages to be entertaining and thoughtful, harmless fun but just serious enough not to seem frivolous., As politically savvy as it is raucous and funny, Barbershop: The Next Cut is a stylish cut above its predecessors., A moderately funny but uncommonly focused ensemble comedy, this isnt just a movie about the gun violence that plagues Chicagos South Side, its a movie that was made in response to it., For a freshly-shaved-chin wag, The Next Cut covers ambitious ground., Just about everything else clicks, thanks in no small part to the wonderful performances from the deep cast., The most fascinating - and the most moving - thing about this sprawling, sincere and boisterous movie is its tone., There are enough moments that feel both real and true to make one hope the latest cut isnt the final one."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,0,"Even filled with flaws and missteps aplenty, I got a serious kick out of this sequel, I enjoyed it far more than I imagined I was going to., The heavily female-centered The Huntsman: Winters War boasts beautiful visual effects and a sense of humor sorely lacking from the original., When people gripe about Hollywoods reliance on sequels and cheap franchise cash-ins, this is the kind of movie they mean: no Grimms Fairy Tale, but a grim tale nonetheless., By cramming far too much material into 114 minutes, The Huntsman: Winters War feels rushed and incomplete., Its certainly a beautiful dud. Its a well-acted dud. But a dud it is, and when it lands, that landing is as heavy as a big, fat, icy snowball., The script lifts so much plot from Disney\s animated Frozen that it could qualify as a remake. No one sings Let It Go, but my advice to audiences is to do just that., Heres hoping that any future installment ditches the Huntsman the way that Snow White was shunted aside, because the evil queens are where its at., Freya is given the barest veil of a backstory while Ravenna just oozes ribbons of black bile (literally) for her own evil reasons. These women may be strong but they are never deep., At least now we have an answer to the question, Who\s the dullest franchise of them all?, Sampling Tolkien, Disney, and Grimm, The Huntsman: Winters War lays on the pastiche in slabs, but no one is slouching here., Now we should worry that studios will use this movies probable failure to discourage future female-centric blockbusters. Dont blame the stars, all wonderful in their limited capacity., Blunt and Theron are game but given little to do but strut and declaim. Hemsworth is fun to watch and there are striking visuals, but that cant make up for a dreary mess., Every resonant theme or intriguing story possibility is stripped away and replaced with a ready-made franchise-movie conceit., Nearly every major character dies and comes back to life at least once and a convoluted narrative yields not a single, palpable moment of drama., Nah, queen., The Huntsman: Winters War is as beautiful as its macho lead actor Chris Hemsworth is handsome. The movie is also as vacuous, silly and boring as Hemsworth is awkward and awful in the title role., The story loses direction like forest wanderers relying on a bread-crumb trail., There would be use for a properly dark Frozen retelling, more in line with the original tale, where the afflicted actually uses her power for malfeasance. But Freya is a snow day late and a dollar short., It serves as both a talent-squandering prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman, while doing nothing more than name-check Snow White., There is a decent movie buried in here somewhere, but with such powerhouse actresses, its dismaying that it feels so regressive from the first."
Criminal ,0,"As a movie, theres plenty here to respect. As entertainment, however, this is tough one to enjoy, all of which makes Criminal a vexing spectacle thats hard to watch all the way through to its end., Its lazy, corrupt and sleazy filmmaking, the kind of film thats killing the business., We can but pray that scientists invent a procedure to remove the memory of ever watching this film in the first place., Costner, in full badass mode, makes this crackpot premise work., The movie is a little more fun than it has any right to be, thanks to its super-serious cast (including Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Gary Oldman, and Gal Gadot) and the straight-faced approach to its ridiculous shenanigans., Criminal is a perfectly passable thriller, if youre cool with no one here passing as an actual human being., Criminal isnt a very good to begin with. It also wastes a solid cast., All the ingredients are there for a pleasant pander to grumpy old white men: the craggy actors, the foreign bad guys wielding confusing technology, the kindness of beautiful young women, and the nobility of sacrifice., A fantastically stupid thriller ..., Criminal is an action-thriller with a science fiction twist. To the extent that its purpose is to energize and involve an audience, it succeeds., Orange is the new black for Kevin Costner in Ariel Vromans crazy sci-fi espionage actioner, a star vehicle that fast and furiously leaps from action set piece to action set piece in an obvious effort to avoid the giant plot holes imperiling the story., Its wanton, low-down entertainment without the flair to pull this stuff off, or the neural stem cells to make wit or logic much of a priority., Neither scriptwriters Douglas Cook and David Weisberg nor Vromen in the directors chair are subtle enough to figure out how to do both action and character., Egregiously silly, generic ..., So much wasted talent. Downright Criminal, it is., Half science-fiction tale, half espionage thriller, its a pleasantly far-fetched endeavor that moves along so briskly that it leaves no time to consider its implausibilities, which are many., Its best not to think about this preposterous story too hard. Just ride it to its even more preposterous climax, enjoying Mr. Costner and a steady supporting cast (Gary Oldman as the C.I.A. honcho; Gal Gadot as Bills wife) along the way., A violent Kevin Costner B-movie., Costner carries it off with a certain growly-voiced deadpan. Like Liam Neeson, he could get a late-career boost in the action genre. But the extreme ridiculousness of everything lets it down, and the violence is deeply misjudged., Criminal is a screwed-up mess as a story and as an action movie with a so-called moral lesson in it. In fact, the more I think about it, the less I like it."
Megan Leavey ,0,"The films gendered Orientalist narrative uses Iraq, its people and the US-led war there as the backdrop for a story about a white woman soldier finding herself and learning to love through her combat canine., A heartfelt and touching film featuring one of Kate Maras best performances., Kate Mara is raw and riveting in the title role, a marine who ends up in combat in Iraq with a bomb-sniffing German shepherd. Its a true story that earns your tears., Director Gabriela Cowperthwaites spare handheld camera work comes into its own once the canine teams are out in the field., Cowperthwaite is a documentarian and brings a low-key naturalism to the storytelling, and Mara is excellent in revealing Leaveys growing sense of confidence and purpose., If youre looking for a good cry, Megan Leavey gets the job done, I suppose. But its a bit like a wet kiss from a puppy., The film - the feature directorial debut for Gabriela Cowperthwaite, whose orcas-in-peril documentary, Blackfish, struck a nerve - treats the handler/dog relationship with respect, not cheap sensationalism., With a female-directed, female-driven film this small, criticizing it feels like beating a baby seal. While well intentioned, the human-and-dog interest story lacks narrative drive and star Kate Mara is a limp noodle., The emotion in Megan Leavey is not forced. It flows, up and down the leash, just like its supposed to., Megan Leavey works because it takes Leavey seriously as a character, and it studies her journey through her life and through the Marines before Rex is even a factor in the story., May not be the smoothest piece of filmmaking, but wears its emotions honestly and benefits from offering a look at a rarely explored arena of human-animal relationships: dogs trained for combat., If the conclusion doesnt bring a tear to your eye, youre way too cynical., Megan Leavey isnt flawless in its structure and thematic priorities, but what it has is a worthy tale of commitment and bravery, which satisfyingly wraps up in a touching finale., As it stands, the movies power never pops off the screen., Kate Mara imbues the role with plenty of grit and pluck but its Rex, the dog she bonds with, who turns out to be a natural in front of the camera., This movie is rarely more than merely competent, but it should stir lovers of justice as well as dog fanciers., This is a good story, well told., This is an affecting story about loyalty, sacrifice, and the forging of identity., If you have a soft spot for dogs, this is a love story youll find irresistible., This is a film that cant decide if it wants to be a war movie or a rescue dog melodrama and therefore falls into cinematic no-mans/womans-land."
Alien: Covenant,0,"Unfortunately, it starts off like youre getting a sequel to Prometheus., Even if the twists and turns in the plot arent too hard to see coming, theres a distinct joy that Ridley Scott takes in setting up and setting off each of those traps., Covenant works best when its honoring Alien and massively fails when it hearkens back to Prometheus., Theres an air of mystery to Alien: Covenant that the movie cant live up to, because for all its interest in what it all means, it has relatively little to show for all that idle questioning., While it may sometimes exceed its own reach, Covenant extends a grasp so impressively audacious, it might as well come from a director with nothing to lose., In space, no one can hear you laugh., Yet again a crew sniffs after a mysterious ping and sticks their nose in a deadly larva pod. Are our astronauts learning? God no. And if the audience expected a different plot, were not learning, either., As redesigns go, Alien: Covenant is not ambitious, but its roaringly, repulsively effective., This may not be a movie that reinvents the wheel. But its one that knows how to make it roll., Its an Alien movie for our times, one in which mankind isnt just under the thumb of an oppressive corporation but sowing the seeds of its own destruction on a more sweeping scale., There are plenty of reasons to shut your eyes and cross your legs while watching this film, but is that the same as being scared?, Director Ridley Scott clearly wants to give us more than *just* an Alien movie. But his film is best when it aims for that simple goal., This desire for procreation and preservation of the self - human, alien or artificial - is what motivates every being in the Alien universe, and in Covenant, Scott sets up a thrilling thunderdome in which we can watch this bloody battle unfold., If this is your idea of a good time, you can tick away the films two-plus hours guessing which crew members will get offed, and in what order., Peel away the big budget genre films veneer of Western Civ for Dummies (Michelangelo, Wagner, Byron and Shelley) and what you have is rather conventional Lego blocks of sci-fi horror., Sure, theres more blood, and guts, to appease fans, but at what cost?, The new film is intended to act as several things, none of them particularly admirable., The first Alien had better special effects. Watch it instead., Unfortunately, Alien: Covenant is not really up to bearing the weight of the yarn it wants to spin., Yet director Ridley Scott -- who birthed the original nearly 40 years ago as well as that last film -- plunges back into the latters mythology, with equally uninspired and perhaps more blatantly derivative results."
Song to Song,0,"... just another minor variation on Malicks favorite theme-the power of love and spirituality to transcend the life-poisoning curses of ambition and greed-and not a very effective one, at that., Remember when Terrence Malick movies happened once in a geological age? God be with the days., Nothing felt real, Mara laments at the start of Song To Song. That, sadly, is an observation that can just as well be aimed at the movie as a whole., At best, the Malick method is a cinematic sacrament. At worst, its a moronic, cringeworthy perfume commercial. Malicks new film, Song to Song, is his worst yet. An absolute shocker., It all adds up to a beautiful nothing., Haters be damed - this is one of the years best., It wont convert the unconvinced, but it is beautiful, melancholic, audacious and well-played, a refinement rather than reinvention of a singular filmmaker., Were left with gorgeous photography (Emmanuel Lubezki), a plotless plot and a sense that some transcendentalist Nashville may lurk here waiting to be discovered, though not - thanks - by me., There are some inspired visual flourishes and it is a film with its own weird stamina and momentum: sometimes exasperating, sometimes mesmeric., The haughtily unenlightened can joke and snipe and snore all the want. As evinced by Song to Song, Malick is operating in top form. If only wed be bothered to do the work of making sense of it., Terrence Malicks latest film isnt so much a movie as it is a freeform collection of whispers and beseeching looks., Though my low expectations were essentially met, I\m tired of Terrence Malick coasting on mediocrity and it being considered experimental, This is the one with Ryan Gosling, and like Terrence Malicks two previous dramas its a gauzy, improvised affair that looks like a photo essay out of Architectural Digest and regards its gorgeous, murmuring actors as if they were statuary., Song to Song is Terrence Malick\s first truly awful film., Its hard to say if the films opaqueness is a distraction, or a saving grace; certainly, this kind of Euro arty ethos is easier to swallow in another language., Song to Song isn\t the sleepy disappointment Malick\s last two films were, but it\s hard not to wish he\d wake up., If Song to Song is a punctuation point in Malick\s search for a new visual language, let it be an instructive one., Some moviegoers will find the experience frustrating; others will be exhilarated by a film thats far afield from the usual formulas., Song to Song is slightly less pretentious than Malicks last film, the 2015 sigh of ennui Knight of Cups, though it features just as many miniature actresses., Song to Song tests its dreamers and wanderers and leaves them a little wiser, maybe, for the experience. And maybe that\s the best way to express how I felt watching it ..."
Sleepless ,0,"Sleepless has the puzzling, 95-minutes feel of a doomed project that has been mercilessly edited to digestible proportions., Its thin but taut and at a lean 95 minutes, it zips along at a propulsive, entertaining clip., The final twist is genuinely unexpected, though purely because of its irrelevance., A smart and speedy cop movie that occasionally reaches for greatness., Less sleepless, more insomnia cure. For all its attempts at action, its a rote, dull crime thriller with little fresh to offer., Alleged action movies need way more novelty than just flour being dusted over the combatants or brief bursts of underwater photography to ring the changes., The sheer silliness defeated me., In its portrayal of cops on the take, Sleepless often resembles an episode of TVs The Shield., Monaghan and Foxx, for all their gifts, cant transcend the material, though they do get more out of it than most others would be able to., The 95 minutes it takes for this sleepless night to unfold onscreen feel tedious rather than breathless., Sadly, even the foggy recollection of the original is better than this bloated bastardization., It might not be Donald Westlake, but it does its thing: meaningless, nonstop violence and movement, enacted by a large cast of characters who are only looking out to survive into the next scene., Alas, Andrea Berloffs screenplay has more holes than a trawlermans net, none bigger than a gut-cut Foxx nursing a gaping wound for two-thirds of the picture while still managing to dodge bullets and roll with the punches., We get muttering and glowering from Mr. Foxx, a story that cant manage enough twists to tie a shoelace, and set pieces that have been done better in other movies., Mostly, everyone goes dutifully through the motions, including Foxx, whose level of investment in the project is neutral at best., The listless, shoddy sort of remake where it feels like all of the characters have already seen the movie theyre in, Sleepless reduces one of the best action films of the 21st century into one of the most benign., One of those movies that needed to be a lot better or a lot worse to make much of an impression., Never rising above the level of generic B-movie, Sleepless represents the sort of disposable fare typically dropped into theaters in January., Sleepless is a propulsive thin exercise, energetic but tedious, the kind of January movie that Jamie Foxx should have permanently graduated from., At a certain point, Odars intense atmospherics - amplified by the throbbing bass notes of Michael Kamms heavy, percussive score - start to feel like the work of a filmmaker on genre autopilot."
Ferdinand ,0,"Cena is excellent as a kind and gentle big boy who doesnt know his own strength., Not that this Ferdinand was for me. Its too obnoxious, too self-involved, the hyperactive antics of pretty much every member of the supporting cast driving me bonkers., Gently subversive ..., With a lovely voice performance from Cena, the spirit of Ferdinand does shine through. But the rest of the story filler is mostly forgettable., John Cena brings kindness and calmness to Ferdinand, the animated adaptation of the classic childrens novel about a bull that would rather smell flowers than charge matadors., Ferdinand is not going to be the next Frozen or Lion King or even the fourth or fifth Ice Age movie, but theres a reason the story is still being told some 81 years after it was first published., McKinnons goat character is in constant and hilarious conversation with her many selves but the awkward handling of the slaughterhouse issue will upset some kids., ... a movie of both substance and silliness. Olés all round., The lurching rhythms of Ferdinand make a clean story feel ungainly and episodic ..., Ferdinand doesnt really do justice to its evergreen and far less cluttered source material., Ferdinand is a load of old bull, in a good way., A mostly pleasant surprise in a year that has produced a lack of stellar animated outings., The movie is bright and peppy enough to hold young viewers attention, though a faithful 1938 Walt Disney short showed more inventiveness in eight minutes., In the title role, wrestler-turned-actor John Cena gives Ferdinand just the right balance of sweetness and strength. He becomes the wholly convincing center of the parable., Nothing mould-breaking, but unassumingly enjoyable., Ferdinand buries the original storys message under frenetic action scenes and grating sidekicks, turning a classic tale into just another flat animated comedy., The good news is that while the movie is susceptible to some pandering, it also takes the storys charming core elements and gives them a contemporary luster., The quality isnt up to Pixar standards, but Ferdinand does hit the sweet spot as far as its target audience is concerned. You know: for kids., And theres so much charm (a bull-in-a-china-shop scene is an instant classic) that this family treat will put a smile on your face, a tear in your eye and an extra bada-boom in your heart., Faced with familiar story tropes and lowest-common-denominator bids for attention, anyone over the target demographic might ask themselves a multitude of questions as the mind inevitably wanders."
Atomic Blonde,0,"A good time - saved by spectacular fight scenes, a colourful cast of supporting characters, and a great lead in Theron., Who do we thank for this refreshing take on the smash-em-up genre and this thoroughly modern woman in a Bechdel-beating blockbuster?... Thank Charlize Theron, Even an actor as good as Theron cant turn a set of cynical commercial considerations into a character., Charlize Theron works furiously to bring some small weight to a character so feathery she barely manages to remain attached to the screen., You forget to breathe. More importantly, you forget to question the needlessly complicated layers of double-crossing that clog up the third act of an otherwise impressively lean piece of storytelling., In a victory for style over substance, it forces the instincts to follow the plot and care about the characters to surrender to its and Therons unrelenting cool., What Theron sells superbly, as she did in Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015, is, simply, ferocity., When the relationships between the leading characters are all so superficial and everyone is deceiving everyone else, it is very hard to engage emotionally with the movie., Watching Atomic Blonde is a cinematic crash course. Its a course in how to crash a movie, and a script, and a cast; how to crash them till nothing is left but smoking smithereens., Most of Leitchs energy goes into the stunts, which have a mesmerising rhythm to them, together with ingeniously intricate choreography., While its not a perfect female-centric spy thriller (lets keep trying), Atomic Blonde winks to the future with exciting possibilities., Theron carries it off with style of course ..., Just because Atomic Blonde acknowledges its own derivativeness doesnt excuse it or redeem it, in the end., The fight scenes are gripping because they look real. Its not the stylistic biff and bash of a superhero film but up-close bareknuckled brawling., A pulsing spy thriller with sex, excellent music and bucketloads of riveting action, Atomic Blonde owes its success to Charlize Therons ability to carry off the role of agent Lorraine Broughton with such confidence and style., Adapting Sam Hart and Antony Johnstons graphic novel The Coldest City, Kurt Johnstad has written a smart exploitation thriller., Its cool and brutal, but with such impressive action credentials you almost wish there were fewer plot devices to distract you as Charlize gets up and at em., Without a doubt one of the greatest action stars of today, Atomic Blonde offers a spectacular platform for Charlize Therons skills., The action in Atomic Blonde is top-shelf; but the plot that knits it together, crucial to any good spy film, is a whole lot flimsier., Its a calorie-free serving of simple pleasures, and sometimes thats exactly what you need."
The Greatest Showman,0,"Give in. Roll up. Sing along., Like Barnum himself, its an elegant fraud, nice enough to look at as long as you dont look too close., This kind of insanity is really fun to watch. The Greatest Showman is a lot of things, but its not boring., As Ive noted, a lot of capital-N names helped make this film. But the director, the bloke who wore a beanie to the red carpet premiere in Sydney, deserves our admiration. He is the showman who, like Barnum, has his name above the door., ... Hugh Jackmans feel-good new film, The Greatest Showman, is where he truly gets to unleash his inner trouper, and he barely stops singing, dancing and flicking around a top hat from beginning to end., The films insistence that Barnums freakshow is born from warm, fuzzy humanity and very contemporary notions of inclusivity is not just historically inaccurate, its at odds with The Greatest Showmans extremely pretty idea of freakery. Pink hair?, The director, Michael Gracey, delivers quick doses of excitement in splashy scenes but has little feel for the choreographic action, offers scant historical substance, and displays slender dramatic insight., Imagine Tod Browning\s 1932 pre-Code horror film Freaks asset-stripped by a third-rate Baz Luhrmann wannabe, the chilling refrain one of us sanitised into something closer to a soft-drink commercial tagline than a menace., This isnt the story of Barnums life, but a formulaic rags-to-riches story grafted onto the broad outlines of Barnums career as a circus entrepreneur., Historians now agree that Barnum wasn\t the one who said There\s a sucker born every minute, but it\s hard to escape the feeling that you\re being sold a poptimist bill of goods here., For all its cheeriness, brio and strong cast, this is a phoney baloney film with heartstring-tweaking, soul-stirring ambitions it is, by a laughable margin, too transparently manipulative to realise., The closest it gets to a hummable toe-tapper is Come Alive, which, at the risk of damning with faint praise, sounds like a Miami Sound Machine D-side., The Greatest Showman is a perfunctory effort in story, music, dance, and direction that proffers empty messages about uniqueness, reaching not for the stars but for bland homogeneity., An old-fashioned musical with a none-more-zeitgeisty songsheet, it may not be a flawless piece of storytelling, but its a pretty decent show., To make room for all the boring songs, historic facts are all but eliminated, leaving only the bare bones of Barnums life., It may not be quite the greatest show on Earth, but Gracey, Jackman and the entire cast are deeply committed to entertaining and leave you feeling an old-school musical thrill., On its own terms, its an achievement. If I was 13, this might please my eyes and ears., Screenwriters Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon whitewash history at every turn, making Barnum a warm, paternal figure beloved by his sideshow performers, wife, and children., This isnt a movie musical. Its a Las Vegas revue featuring songs aiming for high rotation on a Top 40 radio station, one that will doubtlessly enthrall those moviegoers who mistake spectacle for quality., Its a family film whose infectious, crowd-pleasing song-and-dance numbers justify a 105-minute running length when the pedestrian story cant."
A.X.L.,0,"After 2016s Monster Trucks laid a giant goose egg at the box office, what made the folks at Global Road think this similarly themed shaggy mechanical pal tale would fare any better?, Like its titular character, A.X.L is a pastiche of familiar parts constructed in a lab, a blend of science-fiction and extreme sports tropes that result in little more than an audition reel for the films young stars., Its utterly forgettable., It\s a boy and his dog story with elements of Pretty in Pink, Rad and The Wraith, and it\s those references that kinda make this movie work., A.X.L. feels in desperate need of repairs., Meanwhile, the scientists who lost A-X-L spend half the movie watching these events unfold on a computer screen, doing not a danged thing because they want to see how it all pans out. They are, it must be said, lousy scientists., Whats missing is any genuine personality from the robot (or the human characters, for that matter)."
Overlord ,0,"It escalates slowly, it builds, and then when you get to the final third of this film once the horror elements break out its a thrill ride., Overlord is to fact as Churchill was to sobriety, or Trump to modesty., Enjoyable...I didnt care about a single character in this movie, and I didnt care who got blown up...I didnt feel invested, but it was action-heavy enough and well-acted enough to appreciate...once it commits, its really entertaining., Overlord takes many elements youve seen before and creates a mashup thats able to deliver some gory fun, riveting suspense, zombie horrors, and terrifying depictions of modern war in equal measure., It helps to be in the mood for a period Nazi zombie shoot-em-up but its very successful at being a bit of fun and bloody counterprogramming., It\s reasonably good, creepy fun, provided you\re not troubled by fleeting, uncomfortable thoughts like Hey, that screaming bloodthirsty mutant monster could theoretically be a reanimated Anne Frank., Directed by Julius Avery, the movies not a secret Cloverfield sequel, but it is a sci-fi horror movie dressed up in a WWII movies clothes, and a startlingly fun ride., This gory B-movie initially masquerades as a war film, but Nazi-occupied France is simply a convenient setting., The performances... they bring a sort of warmth and wit to the proceedings even when the film itself is not so much as tiptoeing around the ridiculousness as plowing right through the middle of it., If anyone ever wished Saving Private Ryan were more of a B-movie splatterfest, Overlord is the movie for you., Overlords problem is that it doesnt seem terribly interested in showing us who its villains are, and thus significantly mutes the satisfaction of watching them get flamethrowered to death., The procedure isnt a complete success, but the movie wins a few battles in terms of its premise, energy and style, if not the entire war., Avery seems unsure of what to do and settles for mindlessly piling on the gore. The writers appear to give up too., A simple mechanism to deliver squib packs and swear words., The angles are dynamic and jagged, framing the action for maximum shock value. Its as though the design philosophy for Overlord was to try to get banned in the 1950s, and it works., A surprisingly well-made mash-up of old-fashion war movie tropes and proudly disgusting horror-flick shocks. Its a ton of fun., By the end, Overlord feels, if not greater than the sum of its Frankensteined parts, at least a monster worth mashing., For anyone who ever wished Saving Private Ryan were more of a B-movie splatterfest, Overlord is the movie for you., Its oddly sloppy and unambitious, mistaking loud for really crazy., Overlord leaves a wealth of possibilities unmined. One imagines it was more compelling as pitch than finished product."
The Spy Who Dumped Me,0,"Kate McKinnons performance is a bunch of disconnected comic riffs in search of a character., This film doesnt quite come together like it should, it has all of the spy hijinks , and the action, and its a little over the top with the action in some scenes., Fans of action blockbusters might pass up what seems a light-hearted comedy - but theyd miss out. This films action sequences are every inch as bloody and bonkers as those of their male-fronted counterparts., The Bourne Identity becomes somewhat essential late summer viewing for one reason and one reason alone: Kate McKinnon., Dumped Me succeeds because, before spinning into chaos, it makes good, contrasting use of its two leads., The script is all over the shop. Its very clunkily put together., It gets so much right. A sequel, with Morgan in the driving seat, would be awesome., Fogel handles the action set pieces with gusto but fails to make the chick-chat bonding moments seem like anything more than padding., The problem is that the script, by Fogel and David Iserson...offers zilch in the way of laughs., McKinnon works well with her co-star Mila Kunis, although as so often in this kind of film, you suspect that they could get more laughs by doing some extended on-camera improvisation., The Spy Who Dumped Me is a goofy and energetic buddy movie which never manages to be quite as funny as you expect it to be., The end is fun, but the means is awkward., This may not have it all but its another step forward and a fun night out., Its a promising idea that starts well, and although it starts to flounder by the end, Kunis and McKinnon do sterling work making sure it never completely runs out of energy., Way more so than most movies in this genre, the character development and relationship dynamics are so strong, dimensional, moving., A funny, intelligent, self-aware action-comedy that also touches, lightly but intelligently, on the conversation of the moment: the need to give women the credit they are due. I hope there is a sequel., I think this is a new genre that theyre all sort of working their way through it and havent got all the kinks worked out yet but its a genre that works for me., Ultimately, what makes The Spy Who Dumped Me an enjoyable experience is what Kunis and McKinnon bring to the table., As ridiculous as it may get, it still feels true., Thank goodness for McKinnon, who launches this middling material to greater heights through her own sheer will. Now thats a superpower."
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,0,"This film takes an altogether different view of the imitation game. By embracing frauds and failures, it achieves greatness on the sly., As for McCarthy, her performance is less of a revelation than a confirmation of her talents., Perfectly cast., Israel is anti-social and aggressive but you do find yourself rooting for her., The revelation of McCarthys turn is that shes just allowed to be, without apology, without schmaltz., It doesnt hammer anything home. There is no heavy-handed exposition, no back stories. The characters arrive as is., Its a great New York movie. Its a great film about friendship. Its also a great cat movie (if thats your bag)., Can You Ever Forgive Me? is the buddy comedy nobody knew they wanted. It is charming, understated and in parts utterly heartbreaking., Every beat of the film is just so, its portraiture as rich as the characters themselves are barely solvent., We cant believe the two got away with it for so long. But simultaneously we will them on., The screenplay by Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty is well structured, witty and poignant. The funniest moments tend to be the most painful or humiliating ones., For what could have been a sordid and interior little yarn, Can You Ever Forgive Me? positively glows., A poignant and tender caper that doesnt sugar-coat its protagonists with redemptive Hollywood schmaltz, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a dirty martini of a movie youll want to savour., McCarthy is very good at showing how Lees unpleasant bad temper and rudeness were not simply part of her psychological makeup: they were symptoms of existential panic., Can You Ever Forgive Me? resonates as a historical snapshot as well as de-glamorization of the most misrepresented profession in cinema., Everything - performance, script, direction, cinematography - works in perfect concert., A moving hymn to outsiders, this thrives on two criminally good performances from Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant. It also confirms Marielle Heller as one of the brightest directorial talents around., Heller does do a fine job of showing the physicality of Israels morally dubious work., The achievement shared by McCarthy and Heller is to make us understand this woman and, furthermore, to make us care about her., Melissa McCarthy gives a brilliantly calibrated performance that should see her touted on the awards circuit."
Sherlock Gnomes,0,"Kung Fu Panda director John Stevenson keeps the plot moving at a jaunty pace., Actually more fun than the original and guaranteed to make under-10s shudder with delight., Its nowhere near as bad as it sounds..., After two films, this still looks and feels like a franchise driven more by commercial calculation than creative inspiration., A passable, and very-kid friendly, animation which doesnt break the mould, nor overstay its welcome., The only person who can possibly feel good about this whole mess is Elton John, who inexplicably once again licenses his songs for the soundtrack. Hope the checks cleared, Rocket Man., If youre scratching around for something you can bear to sit through with your kids, this is ― to quote another British classic ― mostly harmless. Otherwise, its one for the gnome buffs., There\s some potential for literary humor among the kid-oriented jokes here, but alas, Sherlock Gnomes doesn\t have nearly the wit or charm of the original., Is any of this destitute childs Toy Story especially funny or exciting? Oh my, no., Simply put, Sherlock Gnomes is a dreadful bore., As directed by John Stevenson, its a mildly amusing matinee adventure, and superior to Gnomeo and Juliet in every way., Sherlock Gnomes doesnt quite have the originality and spark to make it a pop-culture phenomenon. Yet its still an enjoyable family adventure with a solid message., No ones bothered to figure what this movie has to offer beyond terrifically tactile stone figures going through the motions of what might be called Generic Animated Action Rescue Plot ..., Robbing Mr. Depp of his indispensable physical presence only highlights the ceramic stiffness of the jokes., With little wit to its name, Sherlock Gnomes becomes far more tedious than playful., Arthur Conan Doyles legendary characters feel as if theyve been air-dropped into a universe where they dont belong."
Crazy Rich Asians ,0,"Crazy Rich Asians represents people and places with so little thought that it upholds a painful, brutal hegemony thats painfully apparent to people who live in Southeast Asia, where the film is actually set., A binge-able series might have been a better way to go, since the script squeezes a sprawling supporting cast into boisterous caricatures and transforms an intricate flow chart of status among Singapores superrich into a flood of affectations., Aside from these important issues of representation and diversity, Crazy Rich Asians marks a welcome return for the funny, giddy, likeable, glamorous Hollywood romcom., Somewhere between My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a Jane Austen novel: meticulous and hilariously alert to social structures, family dynamics and money, with a plucky underdog heroine., Michelle Yeoh takes the acting honours as the heroines steely prospective mother-in-law., Michelle Yoh is terrific not least because... you have her character who is very not funny in a way which is kind of impressive in a comedy., In many ways, this supposed celebration of diversity disappoints. It doesnt matter. Its unpredictable female leads are as good as gold., The director, Jon M Chu, thankfully, knows his rom-coms. Theres Pretty Woman in here. Theres Bridget Jones and Ever After, but hes made them new., And what its doing right is showing white people that they dont own Hollywood any more, and maybe everyone wants to applaud that. In this way, its a terrific film., A good-natured and spectacular comedy..., Director Jon M. Chu keeps the plot racing along as Rachel is introduced to a small army of her boyfriends relatives and friends., The whole film has an idiotic élan. Its a Jane Austen story done as razzmatazz romcom, plus a bit of all-singing, all-dancing Rebecca., Above all, its got that romcom magic. Like any of the best real-life weddings, it makes you simultaneously laugh and cry and go awww! in the kissy bits. Suffering from post-summer holiday blues? Consider them banished., A decadent fever dream of gorgeous people, places and things., This is a glossy, energetic romance-drama-comedy that continues the process of putting Asia in a new light., The best romantic comedy from a big studio since Bridget Joness Diary was released in 2001., Feels blithely liberated from the obligation to offer up suffering that has long been part of the implicit bargain made with so many mainstream movies focused on characters of color-that they are treated as marketable in relation to the pain they portray, Chus direction displays a robust regard for the combined power of glamour and velocity., Its crazy good., Its a boisterous ride that youll want to jump on time and again, still chortling with each rewatch."
Solo: A Star Wars Story,0,"Whats onscreen simply isnt magical enough. It might please die-hard fans to know how Han got the last name or how he made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs...But I think even they might be disappointed., Alden Ehrenreich is a very snappy bit of casting., A scruffy nerf herder in a galaxy far, far, away... Solo: A Star Wars Story, a movie that has no reason to exist, is a fun lovable escapade that gives us a new introduction to the most famous non-Skywalker in the galaxy., How did we get an origin story where Han Solo is not only NOT the most interesting character in the movie, hes honestly maybe sixth or seventh?, Luckily, just as tempers were starting to flare, Solo: A Star Wars Story has arrived to save the day., Franchise fatigue is real and its acutely felt in a galaxy far, far away., The tropes and twists of shamelessly recycled clichés are presented throughout with an absurd earnestness., Even at a stretched two hours, the whole thing feels like an aside - a small, low-stakes story stripped of the mythos and epic scale that make the new crop of Star Wars films land., If youre going to make a film that is essentially a narrative colouring-in exercise, you might as well make it zippy and fun - and thats precisely what director Ron Howard delivers., This is a solid addition to the Star Wars series, with enough action to keep younger viewers in their seats. It doesnt add a lot to the story, but neither does it diminish it., Nothing in Solo can compete with a single scene in The Force Awakens. But what this film does have is cape-clad pilot Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) and his pal, uppity droid L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)., Of all the Star Wars-themed movies, this one is the closest to a Saturday afternoon serial/western. Dont expect more than that., Young Han can only watch helplessly as the gravity of the Star Wars childrens crusade overwhelms him and the wondrous fun run gives way to a joyless slog that actually undermines the heroism of A New Hope even as it seeks to foreshadow it., Solo cant decide how many elements of the primary Star Wars narrative it wants to include, which translates into an uneasy mix of fan service and original thought., Whenever Star Wars tries to develop one of the franchise\s key characters, it whiffs. Solo is no exception, a disappointment on par with The Last Jedi and the prequels., Solo is at its best when its uncoupled from all that heavy lifting, just crammed in a cockpit with its likeable cast and shooting for the stars., If youre going to introduce a prequel to the Star Wars saga in a different way than anyone has tried before, youd better deliver the goods. Solo does exactly that. I think the magic key can be summed up in one word: casting., It doesnt feel like a cohesive piece, so while its at times charming, and does get off the ground in the last act, the getting there is extremely bumpy., Tons of people are going to be entertained by this movie, but it didnt really justify its existence beyond making money., A dizzyingly effervescent spectacle that reminded me precisely why I fell in love with Star Wars as a child."
Social Animals (2018 comedy film),0,"While the story lines sometimes slip into the too-obvious or too-easy, the film has tons of verve and charm and terrific performances from an across-the-board outstanding cast..., The film desperately tries to be wild and out of control, but it ends up as more of a slapdash portrait of cartoony desperation than any sort of realistic depiction of millennial angst when it comes to current-day female lifestyle choices., A limp sex comedy that feels as cinematically played out as the dusty charm of Austin itself."
The Farewell ,0,"What follows is a series of hackneyed scenes about the different interpersonal relationships within the family, centering on the heroines bond with her grandmother., Thematically, The Farewell is about reconciliation with the past and wrestling with cultural traditions that now seem foreign in a country that once was home. But its also simply about grappling with loss..., The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, its one of the best films of the year., Magnificent screen presence. I thought it was really lovely. I thought it was really funny. I thought it was really moving. You will laugh, you will cry., Ultimately, its all about balance, a yin and yang of roots and identities, humour and pathos that comes together into a satisfying, bittersweet wedding banquet of a movie., Youll be spewing with tears before the first act is done., A lovely, warm family picture featuring a star-making turn from Awkwafina., Wangs family story is modestly affecting and deserves an audience, but if it does prompt thoughts about weighing up the importance of emotional truth, they mainly come afterwards., There are no grand declarations or tear-stained confrontations, as its not Downton, mercifully. And if you think grandma knows the truth and is fooling everybody else, you will need to think again, as its just not clichéd in this way., Panic and self-doubt are at the heart of the movie..., The film could have had wit, attitude, poignancy, style - or any single one of the four. Instead it slithers along, shallow and soapy., Immigrant in-jokes abound but this isnt a niche film, its a crowd-pleaser thats been a box-office hit in the US. Not every scene works but its an enjoyable watch and Awkwafina is a revelation in a central role., Goes softly-softly on the Big Themes, but packs an emotional wallop., Both a vehicle for Awkwafinas formidable talents and an incredibly charming ensemble piece. If theres any justice, itll be remembered when it comes to award-scattering season., This is an intricately constructed, deeply personal and surprisingly funny story - one of the real highlights of 2019 in cinema, Theres plenty of humour, especially in the lengthy wedding sequence with its speeches and songs; but the films main strength lies in its sympathetic examination of the differences between the Chinese who have never left China and their cousins..., Immigrants, for whom such experiences often overlap in intimate ways, can tell some of the most compelling stories about the human condition and the dislocating shocks of modernity., Launches no thunderbolts, no dazzling revelations. The film is too gentle for that, with too much affection for its characters., A charming portrait of a family struggle. Beautiful performances and an unexpected--and very welcome--ending., Awkwafina finds her footing as a first-time leading lady, excelling with her emotionally nuanced and vibrant performance in a story about familial love and the gray area one cultivates from straddling different homelands."
The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,0,"All in all, The LEGO Movie 2 feels like more movie than the first one, which somehow winds up making it feel like less., Its only really in the last 20 minutes of the film that it all comes together and you can appreciate what the movie is trying to say about working collaboratively and sharing something you love, If youre willing to let the quantum mechanics slide, youll have a pretty awesome time., There was a super heartwarming theme to it all, one I understood and agreed with. I liked the third act and how it wrapped things up...but just because the message is good doesnt mean that it worked., The Lego Movie 2 has serious points to make about human relationships but undermines them by always reverting to a stance of cheeky self-awareness., The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part might not be as awesome as its forerunner but that doesnt make it any less worthwhile., A semi-brilliant family movie, guaranteed to leave both kids and adults buzzing., By this point... I think Ive had enough of The Lego Movies. These things can only go so far and I think they may have exceeded their natural life span., Viewers reared on The Lego Movie will find plenty to nourish them anew., The final set piece is a little protracted, but the jokes are mostly sharp and enjoyably self-referential and the songs still catchy., Not only is it funny and visually arresting... but it manages to do something which is really quite complicated., Suffice to say that its a hell of a ride, with poignant things to say about the earnestness of adolescence and the frustrations of sibling conflict., The Lego Movie 2 ensures that you will leave the cinema hall, feeling good and on a hopeful sugar high., The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part sets itself apart with zany touches but an acknowledgment that its audience has grown up., Exhausted, and exhausting., And while it takes a few beats to rediscover the manic rhythm of the original, about half an hour in, every piece more or less clicks, and I will not apologize for that sentence., Lego 2 is like stepping on a Lego., A hugely ambitious sequel, joyous and genuinely complex, thats charged with dramatic and musical energy to the very last frame., The expression more of the same isn\t always what artists want to hear, but for The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part it is very good news indeed., It deals subtly but frankly with three of the most annoyingly painful human experiences: fighting with siblings, adolescent moodiness, and stepping on LEGOs in bare feet."
The Sun Is Also a Star,0,"The pacing can be quick, but overall this film will warm the heart of any hopeless romantic., Yes, its both too bad and too good to be true, but there could be no better time for such fantasies., For tween and teen fans of the book and love stories in general, the Nicola Yoon adaptation The Sun is Also a Star will provide a romantic, if sometimes meandering, viewing experience., The Sun is Also a Star might be the most infuriating film Ive seen in 2019., For all of its well-meaning examinations of race, The Sun Is Also a Star rests upon troubling casting...In many regards, The Sun Is Also a Star fights itself., I believed in Natasha and Daniel; I believed in the implausibility of their day. And I believed in the movies mission, however overpronounced., Shahidi and Melton are charming and utterly watchable together. Theyre both absurdly attractive and skilled actors, but whatever magic exists between them is limited by Tracy Olivers script., The sun, the moon, the stars and all sorts of cosmic gobbledygook are thrown into The Sun is Also a Star, a love story that shows how difficult it is to manufacture fate on screen., Although devoid of sophistication and overly dependent on contrivance, the frothy, fizzy giddiness of the love story may win over viewers who are predisposed to enjoy this sort of entertainment., While time is likely on the side of its leads, their chemistry only goes so far in what feels, finally, like a half-baked movie., The Sun Is Also A Star fell far short of my expectations, offering a romance that never manages to shine., Its a tightly wrapped microcosm of many of the conversations driving our political zeitgeist., Once again, with the odds stacked against them, two extremely attractive people have fallen in love., We are told again and again that both protagonists have urgent, life-shaping matters to attend to, but-as portrayed on screen-the stakes couldnt feel less consequential. Nor could the circumstances that keep throwing them together feel more contrived., Oliver and director Ry Russo-Young (Before I Fall)... dont go far enough to mask the skimpiness of the story, which has been whittled down to Natasha and Daniel almost exclusively., Forget physics. These teens need to work on their chemistry., The leads are so lovely and the city is so shimmery that its hard not to get caught up in its spell-for a while, at least, until its corny coda., Under the perfectly paced direction of Ry Russo-Young, Shahidi and Melton develop an easy chemistry on the way toward a satisfying denouement thats neither tear-jerking tragedy nor fairy-tale wish fulfillment., Its all quite wistfully romantic, and mostly winningly so, despite the sometimes wise-way-beyond-their-years dialogue and not always plausible plot., When youre looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesnt seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse."
Clemency ,0,"Clemency is proof of just how effortlessly Woodard can lead a film., A masterwork., Woodard, unshowy and preternaturally still, offers us a stubborn professional being steadily eaten up by her involvement with the glacially slow killing-machine., It takes an actor of Woodards calibre to show us how Bernadine arrived at this point, and why she finds herself so conflicted., Clemency is one of those deliberately harrowing movies that leaves you feeling elated. The very precision of the film-making gives you a sense of hope., The moral and ethical debates around the death penalty rarely touch on the toll it takes on the people involved, but thats the grey area writer-director Chinonye Chukwu explores with a humanists touch and an keen ear for all her characters., Chukwus devastating and complex character study advances the discourse around capital punishment beyond the usual contrived talking points., Its a towering performance from Woodard, her career masterpiece, and she is first among equals in an outstanding cast., Woodards, obviously, is the talking-point performance, a ridiculously nuanced turn that will keep drama students occupied for years., Moving. Woodard is superb. A good way to spend your time., Alfre Woodards work in the death row drama Clemency offers ample proof that she is operating at the highest altitude of screen acting., Once or twice, the script falls prey to underlining. More often, the story speaks for itself, accompanied by stark, eloquent visual choices., Alfre Woodard gives an unforgettably moving performance in Chinonye Chukwus slow-burning, perfectly observed drama about the repercussions of state-sanctioned violence, in which the stakes could hardly be higher., Its Woodards movie, and her characters silent anguish rests just below the surface of her stone-faced veneer. Its a powerful performance in a powerful movie., Clemency establishes its tone quite quickly, one that mirrors the life of Bernadine. It is one of clipped and workmanlike scenes of her life., The real question isnt whether this person or that person will be executed, but whether Bernardine will go to pieces, and yet with a performance like Woodards at the center, thats all a movie needs., Its the kind of film that stays with the audience long after the credits roll. Unlike a pretty little gold statuette, thats not something that can fit neatly on (director) Chukwus mantle but she should cherish it nonetheless., I hate the amateur quarterbacking Im about to engage in, but that Woodards performance did not merit an Academy Award nomination is damning., While admittedly spartan in its stylistic approach, Clemency is wrenching in its performances and direction., Clemency isn\t exactly a good time at the movies, but it\s definitely an enlightening one."
Little ,0,"When the film is funny, its hilarious, but the comedy is too spread out, and not even the central performances can save it., I liked it, but its also not that great., Little is mostly a charming comedy with a killer soundtrack and heart to spare., While its funny, it also touches on important questions such as how our behaviour towards others can come back to bite us. Martin, 14, is a revelation., There are many sequences that are funny and winsome on their own, but as a movie, it doesnt cohere., Little ends up being the little (ha!) film that could and injects itself with enough heart and humor to keep you curious and intrigued for its entire runtime., Its enough to make me guardedly recommend the film. But, nonetheless, Little is no Big., The cheerful action offers several moments of snappy comedy but feels largely forced; the road to the happy ending is long and narrow., The film is cute enough, even if key ideas arent especially novel: its lonely at the top; we need to connect with our inner child; everyone is insecure as a teenager., Deeply contrived, narratively flawed and criminally mirthless high concept comedy., Little is essentially a one-joke movie, but Martin is so charming as a mini tyrant that it gives the joke legs., Shes funny, she has good comic timing...but its grating at length, and this is very much at length...the concept burns itself out too quickly., As many times as I tried to get onboard with its proposed brand of breezy fun, it kept kicking me off, if only because I found myself running up against the very foundation of its premise., Instead of seeing the world through a childs eyes, little Jordan continues to see it through the filter of big Jordans psyche. Worse than a disappointment, thats a betrayal of the original premise., Little is a big case of missed opportunities left to rot in the sun, the resulting stench so heinous heres hoping Ill never have to smell their like again anytime soon., Little is a star vehicle that its actors elevate beyond being Big in reverse; I just wish that the material could elevate its stars, too., Given a premise that is novel but not new, a script that is worthy but not stellar and a location that is overused, the cast succeeds regardless., The film is generally at its best when Regina Hall is on screen, behaving at her nastiest., It becomes very tiresome very quickly. And, no, the film\s central message, that it\s important to, like, be yourself, doesn\t help., Like most Hollywood movies that pretend to question the values of the filthy rich, Little implicitly endorses them."
Child's Play ,0,"I think they made a lot of good reasons for this remake to exist., Overall, this is a fun 90 minutes, if you are into this sort of thing., At the very least, it achieves the baseline desire of a horror reboot: its fun, its scary, and it doesnt trample all over a legacy., Even Aubrey Plaza and the voice of of Luke Sywalker (OK, its Mark Hamill) as devil doll Chucky, cant save this botched reboot., Aimed squarely at the late-night Friday night crowd, in its own right Childs Play 2019 is unexceptional., Child\s Play is good humored and gratuitously gory but feels rushed, and oddly contained to its small world., This oddball blend of 80s nostalgia and contemporary humor never quite lands the smart-scary balance in its sights., The design of the Chucky doll is underwhelming. The films emphasis on over terror oftentimes works against its best interests., The violence is OTT but rarely feels cheap because the tone is so knowing., This playful reboot of the 1988 horror comedy relaunches the Chucky series, gently twisting its central conceit to reflect more contemporary anxieties., Who would have guessed that a Child\s Play film would leave us with less popcorn-rattling jump scares and more existential questions about the role of Alexa in our lives?, This goes up there with the reboot of Poltergeist and Pet Sematary as features you wont remember were remade in a few years., Chucky 2.0 lacks the sinister menace of the original, but the new movie is still a winner in large part thanks to a strong lead performance from Gabriel Bateman, and a highly enjoyable blend of camp and violence., Theres a throwback retro-gore charm to it...much better than I expected. I enjoyed myself, watching it breathe new life into this., Better than I thought it was going to be. The performances are, for the most part, strong, and it has a fun 80s vibe to it...I certainly didnt hate sitting in the theater., Although Childs Play is only 90 minutes long, its one of those movies where you check your watch so often you think it has stopped., The new Childs Play isnt completely irredeemable, but its a shell that ultimately doesnt have that much personality, whether its that of a serial killer or a baby robot., While the movie initially features modestly clever wrinkles, the satirical and technology-inspired elements recede as the conventional slasher bits take over., Its a toothsome turn from Hamill, who knows a thing or two about infantilised villainy, having voiced the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series., Its silly, even nigh nonsensical, full of flat stock characters, plot non sequiturs, and a hand-wave-y take on technological dystopia that never manages to get above eye roll levels of sincerity. But its also fun and funny."
The Aftermath ,0,"Knightleys character is - hello! - more sympathetic and sensual than in the novel, while Clarkes is more one-dimensional, to the point of caricature., It does not achieve the emotional resonance that its looking for, but Keira Knightly does wear some great dresses., A shallow excuse for attractive actors to get their kit off., When all of these various plot strands do finally collide they do so with a heavy-handed thud thats both obnoxiously coincidental as well as being emotionally disingenuous., The film aspires to be an epic romance but the qualities necessary to make it soar arent in place. Instead, its a curiosity for history buffs and those who enjoy middling period piece melodramas., Its moves are telegraphed to anyone whos ever seen a stately period romance, and its handsome production cant overcome its myriad clichés., The Aftermath wants to be a great war romance, but its stuck inside of Hamburg with the Casablanca blues again., The Aftermath is a lot of pretty mush. Or, rather, it\s like suds; its lovely bubbles pop, leaving nothing behind., From the moment Rachael and Stefan look into each others eyes while we roll OUR eyes, The Aftermath is a runaway train of cornball cliches., A soapy wartime melodrama with a disturbing whiff of both sides-ism., Its an enjoyable deviation from the typical war story, but if there were more layers of warmth and stronger emotional connections between the characters, it could have built to a more satisfying conclusion., Unfortunately, a weak screenplay co-written by Anna Waterhouse and Joe Shrapnel (what a pen name) drags everything down as the film takes a page from every illicit historical romance in history., From the title on down, most of the drama in The Aftermath seems to have already happened off-screen., I kept thinking of Donald Duck\s nephews: For all its noble intentions, The Aftermath is dewey, gooey and, even with its moments, hooey., There\s a ripping good story buried somewhere in The Aftermath, an intriguing but ultimately disappointing story set in the rubble of post-World War II Germany., The movie is both ridiculous and enjoyable., There\s nothing wrong with Aftermath, but for one strange and nagging thing: To watch it is to want to be far away from its world and everyone in it., I left with endless troubling questions unanswered. The melodrama turned shallow. I loved the beauty and tenderness, but I didnt believe The Aftermath., The aftermath of WW2 is a resonant topic that is totally botched here. Whats left is soap opera, leaving suds that even the stellar Knightley, Skarsgård and Clarke cant rinse off their performances., An emotionally constipated movie about emotional constipation."
Crawl ,0,"Its really fun, exciting, and does exactly what it needs to do., Crawl could really do with some sense and structure to go along with all these earnest emotions., Perfectly good, if disposable, popcorn entertainment..., Aja gleefully embraces the imperative of every horror film - that the dispensable characters have to die horribly so that we understand completely the consequences for the protagonists., Crawl benefits from its economical 87-minute runtime, but as a genre piece its perhaps more skin than muscle., Note perfect, impeccably timed, thrillingly stressful, brilliantly cinematic, inventively gory, and under 90 minutes., Crawl isnt Jaws, any day of the week, but its crunchy Friday-night nonsense that knows what its doing., Outside: that is the weather. Inside: it is the swishy, corrugated, murder-eyed mega-lizards, CGId so skilfully they look more real than the real., if you dont want to gasp and groan and wince and jump your way through all the pain and terror, and to feel the frustration of rising waters, circling reptiles and snapping teeth - then caveat emptor. The rest of us will be just fine with it., There hasnt been a decent croc movie since 1999s Lake Placid and this is just the latest to lack, ahem, bite., As a mindless summer horror diversion, Crawl is watchable if rarely all that thrilling. The movies far from toothless, yet often substitutes easy scares for any real substance, and suffers for that., For viewers seeking summertime relief from the intellectual burden of superhero movies, theres this accidentally funny and numbingly literal action thriller., Though not a patch on Lewis Teagues charming Alligator, a steady dose of more action-thrillers like this may help send comic-book carcinoma into remission., Crawl is lean, mean fun, and in a summer of overwrought art-horror and mean-spirited studio remakes of indie faves, this classic, old-school creature feature is the cleansing bloodbath we need., Whats likable about Ajas new thriller, Crawl, is how the director pares down his indulgences into a fine, sharp point., Crawl is not exactly an inventive film. But it doesnt have to be. It delivers on what it promises, and not many big-studio movies this year can claim the same., Its toothless despite its alligator antagonists, not least because it never bothers linking its premise - a category 5 hurricane in Florida that causes a flood - to the existential threat hastening such extreme weather events in the first place., Crawl would look pretty good in just about any season. In this one it positively glows., Like the apex predators slithering at the center of it all, it gets the job done once it lets is more brutal, primal instincts take over., Crawl is dumb genre fun, but its not too dumb... If any one thing holds back this modest, skillfully made potboiler from true B-movie glory, its the human drama."
The Owners ,0,"Williams and her contemporaries are excellent. The senior actors do, however, steal the show. Its lovely to see both having such a disreputably good time., Berg, who has worked mostly in French TV and makes his feature debut here, has a knack for ratcheting up suspense and finessing the technicalities in order to maximise the creepiness., From this chaotic clash between different classes and generations, a genre-distorted picture emerges of contemporary Britain where property is in the hands of senior citizens, and the have-nots are forced to keep living with their elders., An aptly gross-out, even amusing horror movie that comes with a satisfying (albeit a now-formulaic) twist., The Owners proves a nasty, if not exactly credible, thriller., Tense, uneasy and brutal, escalating from the creepy to the ludicrous over the course of 92 deliberately unpleasant minutes."
The Midnight Sky,0,"The Midnight Sky shines with Clooney\s deep and abiding belief in the human condition, in compassion, in ... redemption is the wrong word, too Catholic. Rather, in connection, even if it is brief, even if it is seemingly one-sided., The two-hour running time seems like two years as it drags on indefinitely., This is an odd movie overall. The pacing is slow - in the space sequences I started wishing for Darth Vader to turn up - and the music, by dual Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat, is overbearing., The Midnight Sky is a good example of a movie that sells itself short by trying to be one thing -- serious, heavy, emotional -- when, by all available indicators, it should be more of a thriller, or more ridiculous, or at the very least more fun., A beyond-bleak post-apocalyptic thriller, the sci-fi film reaches a reasonably satisfying finish, but follows an uneven orbit in getting there., George Clooney stars in this space parable that starts out well, then goes adrift. I felt like Id seen it before, such is the familiarity of its plot points and its most ambitious action scenes, But my heartstrings were still tugged, and even if the contrivances required to bring things to a conclusion are a little obnoxious, I cant work up the energy to get bent out of shape about it., It may seem appropriate that a space epic is short on atmosphere (sorry), but that pun doesnt help sustain attention during the uninteresting crises and unsurprising traumas., Clooney, who directs here, generates neither pulse nor point. His film has some visual flair, but too few emotionally engaging moments. The Midnight Sky is mostly a dull affair., The Midnight Sky looks beautiful... But once the stakes are established, the film struggles to fill the rest of its time., The sleek sci-fi visuals occasionally elevate it, although more often its just a bit of a slog., At its best, the film shimmers with a thoughtful, poetic moodiness. At its worst, its pretty damn slow., Clooneys space drama looks lovely but lacks drama and tension., The films themes of extinction and survival are worthy of thoughtful treatment, something that eludes the ambitious movie as it succumbs to a schematic and sentimental telling that overreaches for a grand gesture and obscures the more meaningful ideas., If it were just half as slow, Midnight Sky would be half as long and twice as good., You want your money back, but its on Netflix., The Midnight Sky unfolds across several timelines, yet none of them register on a human or a basic storytelling level. It\s like the apocalypse arrived and nobody bothered to put up a fight., In making this film, Clooney has accomplished something rare and unusual in todays cinema - an epic science fiction motion picture that focuses on characters and ideas., Its a carefully balanced movie that gives as much time to human connections, loss, regrets and hope in the small moments as it does to what we reveal of ourselves when survival is at stake., The films conclusions are simple, but worthy of the drama: life carries on if it can, and thus ideally so does some sense of ourselves, whatever meager or profound contribution we made to the world - or beyond."
The Secret: Dare to Dream,0,"The Secret: Dare to Dream wants to remind us of those bland, coastal Nicholas Sparks romances where white, pretty people don resort wear to take walks on beaches and barbecue shrimp together., If you\re looking for 107 minutes of utter pabulum disguised as a motion picture with characters and a plot, well, you should Dare to Dream no more., Its otherwise an admirably mellow experience... But zoomed out just a bit, Dare to Dream reveals more insidious dimensions., You wont derive much inspiration from The Secret: Dare to Dream besides some unintentional laughter to briefly brighten your day., The Secret: Dare to Dream at best feels like a tepid distraction even for those receptive to its blueprint, far from the stuff that dreams are made of., The Secret: Dare to Dream is innocent and innocuous enough to make Nicholas Sparks look like David Lynch., Once you start this film, you might not want it to end., Its the sort of movie in which kids express their desire for a pepperoni pizza during a torrential storm, and a few seconds later a pizza deliveryman miraculously appears at their front door., The Secret: Dare to Dream, a romantic drama about the power of magical thinking, may not be the worst movie of 2020, but it has to be the dopiest., Its a frothy, forgettable translation of the hit book that takes its central belief system and uses it as the basis for a vaguely magical romantic drama for moms., Whoever put the new film The Secret: Dare To Dream on their vision board should be locked up., Littered with confounding clichés and hokey devices, its the exact inverse of what a passionate romance should aspire to be, let alone one preaching the power of positivity., The film becomes so bad that no amount of positive thinking - as recommended by Rhonda Byrne\s 2006 mega-selling nonfiction book The Secret, from which this narrative film is drawn - can save it."
All the Bright Places ,0,"Its pure beating heart and humanistic undertones make it somewhat of a standout., A refreshingly sober spin on YA romance., Elle Fanning and Justice Smith are gorgeous together and have lovely chemistry., Theres messaging inserted near the start of the end credits for those who might be affected by the themes raised. But it doesnt negate what comes before it: a film that lingers briefly in the deep end but remains disappointingly shallow., Though it\s not without humor, All the Bright Places takes teens\ emotions seriously and will move romantics of any age - in possibly unexpected ways., Smith and Fanning bring thoughtful performances to this delicate tale., In the grand scheme of YA films, Bright Places is top-shelf."
After We Collided,0,"A series of half-digested movie tropes regurgitated by Google Rom-dram., American Afternators will no doubt be similarly pleased with this slightly campier continuation of the series. For everyone else, however, there\s not enough innovation to make the second installment a worthwhile jumping-on point., Too moronic to work as a serious romantic drama and too boring to work as straightforward sleaze., After was merely awful. After We Collided is atrocious."
Shirley ,0,"Shirley Jacksons life is adapted to a movie thats as complicated and interesting as the authors writing., Despair, desire, and madness are all entangled in Josephine Deckers Shirley..., A look at the very morose Shirley Jackson (Elisabeth Moss), presented in a way that mimics the famed fiction authors horror writing..., The film is so performatively uncomfortable in its own skin that you may find it struggles to worm its way under yours., Shirley is sensuous and beguiling, an act of pure witchcraft., There are heavy dollops of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? here, but without the campy histrionics., Id rather see something aim high and fall than just play it straight...with a great and weird and haunting soundtrack and a fantastic performance..., Together, Moss and Stuhlbarg epitomise a very horrible masculine and feminine mystique., Dont trust me is the message - one underlined by the cutting of the film, meant to make you lose your footing. And then there is Moss, teeth and intellect bared in a snarl, as ever in an acting category all of her own., Through all the films fictionalised, domestic delirium, Decker tells a story of female artistic power., Part psychological horror, part erotic thriller, with none of the conventions of a biopic, Shirley will keep you enthralled (and guessing) until the very last second., A bewitching - if discordant - attempt to bottle the atmosphere of Jacksons particular genius., Its a flawed mistress-piece. I cant wait to watch it again., Decker and Gubbins zig just where you might expect them to zag - but for all their departures from fact, theyre not bold enough to give the tale quite the kind of vicious twist Jackson herself could be counted on to deliver., Its the performances that save this movie for me. It has a very unique style of cinematography that sometimes grated on my nerves, but I think that was the intended outcome., Theres something magical watching Moss weave her incisively ferocious spell., The details are smudged and fudged, but Shirley unpacks the crux of one of the 20th centurys great writers, evoking not just her life but the existential terror that she and women like her were always facing, and still do., Deckers filmmaking is often dreamlike, but her storytelling has a cruel bite of reality to it-just as Jacksons writing did decades before., Its easy to admire the performances without feeling like the journey adds up to much. While Moss captures the complexity of Shirleys personality, the movie sheds scant light on the underlying why of it all., The movie feels not a little like Who\s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? with a literary George and Martha tormenting each other for fun."
"Love, Guaranteed",0,"If likability is a trait you value, Love, Guaranteed delivers the undemanding pleasure of watching two fundamentally decent people tumble into fondness and then love., It is sufficiently harmless and blandly cozy, like a Hallmark Channel movie that somehow broke loose and found its way to Netflix., Before anyone pulls out the guilty pleasure card - no. There is zero pleasure here, no matter how low your bar is currently set. Only pain. So much pain., Its successes are due in large part to Cook who, donning a vast array of snug fall coats, is endearing as a willful working woman with a new crush., Passably entertaining, a silly and forgettable but mostly charming diversion that should see other 90s has-beens clamouring for their own star vehicles."
Money Plane,0,"In the history of dumb ideas, few have been stupider than the Money Plane."
Diary of a Wimpy Kid ,0,"Its the little dramas that are the meat of it, and Kinneys script is particularly brilliant when it comes to capturing the petulance and cruelty with which hurt children can lash out at their friends., Incarnated in gently bulbous, digitally smooth form, our hero, Greg Heffley (voiced by Brady Noon), runs through a good-natured medley of misadventures over 56 episodic minutes., While the wholesome-minded product feels a tad redundant, it establishes its own identity, improving upon its cinematic predecessor enough to make it a worthwhile watch."
Spiral ,0,"I like being scared; what I dont particularly like is being grossed or winced out., I have to admit, I liked this film...and a great opportunity to get back into a theater., Director Darren Lynn Bousman, on his fourth Saw film, keeps things fresh while also nodding, via the pig mask and a scene involving handcuffs and a hacksaw, to where it all began in 2004., In trying to save itself, the Saw series got caught in a convoluted trap of its own making., Here you have really good actors in a really mediocre movie., I was just happy watching Chris Rock having fun in this movie, even if I wasnt really having fun watching people get their limbs torn off., The film conveys no coherent message, except as a warning to makers of mash-ups: throwing an unusual set of ingredients into the blender may be a way of creating something fresh, or it may simply result in an indigestible stew., An earnest, overproduced piece of Saw fanfiction without the cheap thrills., If Saw ever had its day, the sun has long since set on it. There seems to be little point in exhuming it for a new generation., Even the torture porn murders have lost their gross-out value, and are now just brutal and kitsch., Spirals too-restrained storylines here are clearly an unfortunate side effect of its ambitions toward a more venerated generic bent..., No matter who the killer is targeting with his latest schemes, its Rock whos the victim here, and he does not escape unharmed., If the title implies a certain motion, the main direction the movie heads is essentially down the drain., Its hammy and predictable, where it should be lean and nasty., It cant decide whether it wants to be a horror movie attached to a police procedural, a police procedural attached to a horror movie, or a Bulgarian knock-off of Law and Order: Special Hostel Division., Spiral: From the Book of Saw is more frustrating than the average mediocre horror sequel because you can easily decipher the wasted opportunity up there on the screen., The last three traps weren\t gory enough feels among the more depressing critical judgements I\ll ever bestow., Spiral: From the Book of Saw is a mixed bag of gruesomely bloody tricks., The Spiral team gets the traps right, but thats about it. A hugely disappointing installment loaded with so much untapped potential., Spiral returns to the roots of the franchise, with its Se7en-like grungy aesthetic and grisly murders that nourish the cravings of extremity horror hounds."
The Birthday Cake ,0,"Given its meandering script and absurdly grand guignol ending, its astonishing that The Birthday Cake could attract such a starry cast., No matter how you slice it, this star-studded mob film still seems undercooked., Giannopoulos might be inexperienced, but hes canny with mood and unafraid to experiment with the rhythms of violence. I, for one, am keen to see what he does next."
Wrong Turn ,0,"Wrong Turn finds its agile equilibrium in the balance between being a film of ideas and a film with a body count., Efficient and enjoyable. A couple of horrifying and haunting moments. The whole thing doesnt make any sense at all, and it scores zero points for originality, but it has a really haunting final shot and it does exactly what it set it to do., Wrong Turn has some decent booby-trap business but cant find enough that is different to enliven the weary concept. But for the horror hardcore, keep watching once the credits roll., Just because the film takes itself too seriously doesnt mean a viewer has to., Its a bit silly and queasy, but the narrative motor keeps humming., Wrong Turn is a brutally uncompromising descent into unflinching terror that kept me on the edge of my seat., McElroy and Nelson evolve Wrong Turn into a bizarre, winding odyssey, albeit with a lot more on its mind than just a cool kill., This new update shares commonality with the franchise in name only, opting instead to create a tonally-confused road trip into the unpredictably bizarre."
Licorice Pizza,0,"... As perversely delicious as its title., Really stands up alongside (Anderson’s best work). It feels authentic for the time, and gives us a new star in Cooper Hoffman , Licorice Pizza, like Phantom Thread, is a study of magnetic human connection that isn’t necessarily good for either party — but then, magnetic human connection rarely thinks that way, or thinks at all. , It’s a joy, and the sort of film that like a great LP -- it’s named after a Californian record store -- you’ll want to play over and over., Theres a looseness  a dreaminess, an illogic  to how it all unfolds and meanders that is somehow still incredibly authentic., The two leads, musician Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman, each in their feature film debut, are remarkable., Licorice Pizza takes an arms-length embrace of nostalgia. Anderson doesnt turn a blind eye to reality-he heightens it, weighting it with meaning, reflecting the romance of hindsight and adolescent abandon., One thing I really like about this movie is the way its structured, because its meandering and its loose but all these little moments, they feel like stories and anecdotes and memories that have been told and recounted many times., Anderson and Haim, with her sharp-elbowed and funny yet soulful performance, capture the flailing, directionless condition of being a woman in her mid-20s., This is a film carried by two people whove basically never acted before, but Anderson somehow knew that they could, and neither hits a false note in over two hours. Its a star-crossed love story à la Harold and Maude minus the tragedy., This film - which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture - will command a second (and third) watch., Gary is played by Cooper Hoffman, the teenage son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and hes captivating, full of chutzpah and with such a good, imperfect, real face., Like any LP worth its salt, this is one where youll want to be dropping the needle on over and over again., The twists and turns in the script seems desultory. That is, until you realise the whole point of Licorice Pizza is to demonstrate that most heterosexual adult males suck., This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucass American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge., The fullest expression yet of a certain kind of narrative antipathy that has crept into Andersons toolkit and almost overwhelmed his last outing, the frequently dreadful Phantom Thread., One can scarcely imagine a more enjoyably chaotic way of welcoming in the new year. What a blast., Such is the energy Anderson whips up, forever sending in chaos from the edge of the frame. The result is a giddy freewheel in which scenes never end how you or the characters expect, and whats coming next is anyones guess., The things in Licorice Pizza that are so good, like the performances from Haim and Hoffman and Cooper and the period fidelity, make you wish that the entire movie was just as good., Looser and funnier than his recent efforts, sharper and more formally assured than his earliest films, this is Paul Thomas Anderson operating at full capacity. A master at work."
Back to the Outback,0,"Gorgeous character design and some delightful voice performances elevate this uneven CGI romp in which a bunch of ugly Australian animals break out of a zoo and head for the outback., The slapstick is seasoned with some dryly laconic jokes and a lot of wit has gone into the score, which ranges from surfing hits to Charles Aznavour., Theres just too little fresh creative passion here in a project thats sometimes sweet but also remarkably programmatic., Clare Knight and Harry Cripps film walks the walk well enough. But theres a funnier, more eccentric adventure underneath it all, straining to make its own return to the wild., However generic this movie is in premise, there is wit to be found in its details, and warmth in its message., The moral is clear as day to any kid, though plenty of adults could use the reminder: Never judge any creature by the way they look. And, for animation devotees, the lesson is the same: Never judge a cute animated offering by its platform., The aesthetic of the animation is, like the script, rather nondescript, with boilerplate-looking gloss and shine - like any number of less memorable DreamWorks or Pixar productions."
Blue Bayou ,0,"An angry, passionate film from writer-director and leading actor Justin Chon., Multi-hyphenate Justin Chon has crafted an impressive melodrama, rich in Louisiana atmosphere and with a timely message, but Blue Bayou is marred by its reliance on symbolism and sentiment., Chons directing choices are bold and sometimes interesting, but the screenplay - a big old overcooked melodrama that chucks in everything from a motorcycle chase to a terminal cancer subplot - is an almighty mess., If Chon had pared his own script back, laid off the pathetic fallacies and nudged away his influences ...we might have had the drama the awful truth deserves., This is, without doubt, the most overstuffed, overwritten movie of 2021., A documentary would have better served the real-life adoptees who face this issue., Americas equivalent of the UKs Windrush scandal is the driving force behind this fierce heartbreaker..., Although his story is rooted in the tougher realities of American society, Chon knows how to combine truth and beauty., I sincerely hope that this is a film that were talking about during awards season., Vikander has never been better, and Chon is open and present, particularly so in the scenes with Kowalske., Chons ambitions are astonishing, but his bloated script needed an edit or two. Its a film written with big moments for big performances in mind, which is too painfully obvious as the film treads on., The well-intentioned but emotionally overwrought Blue Bayou takes an underexplored issue - the deportation of immigrant adoptees - and lays the melodrama on so thick that it\s suffocating to the senses., The high points are devastating and show off Chons empathetic storytelling. But at its ebb, the film tries to do too much at once, spilling every which way., Its a lovely and heartrending piece of filmmaking., Blue Bayou strikes a nerve, of that there is no doubt. But then it keeps poking at it, pointlessly., Blue Bayou is designed to jerk tears out of a plainly tragic scenario, but all it does is expose the strings behind the puppets and the set., Beautifully relaxed family scenes help us forgive the ponderous direction..., The lead performances are sterling., Blue Bayou moved me a lot more than I expected or maybe even wanted it to., A tale of intergenerational traumas and personal redemptions that is an emotionally complicated yet ultimately cathartic viewing experience"
Mayday ,0,"Filmmaker Karen Cinorres initially provocative vision of misandrist vengeance at least makes Mayday worth a look., Its an interesting cast and its a beautiful film. Kind of falls apart by the end, but I liked it for a while., Despite a strong ensemble of actors and some impressive photography, Mayday drowns inside its own overambitions., This is a music video, not a film, with storytelling that neither shows nor tells., Cinorres opening is electrifying but its focus eventually wavers like a faraway radio signal., For a film about misandrist revolutionaries, Mayday lacks the courage of its convictions - it sets up boogeymen as targets only to shoot them point blank, in broad daylight., The film circles a thorny premise, which makes it all the more disappointing that it results in a conventional clinch., A curious magical realism metaphor for feminist despair..., With no tension, no suspense and no dramatic engine behind this plunge through the looking glass, Cinorres film feels less like a narrative than an incredibly polished advertising campaign..., For viewers happy to go with the flow... this will be fun enough., While the plot is not always entirely coherent, Mayday is strikingly styled and suffused with a punchy, militarised feminism., Mayday seeks to examine the issues of gender, suicide, and youth through a thin fantasy lens, but it never finds a confident wavelength and meanders when it needs to be world building., Its a shame that ambitious vision doesnt extend to its characters - where theyre from, who and what they love, the real experiences that inform their resiliency., Despite a rigid, smart setup, Mayday sloughs off its sharper elements with increasing regularity."
Orphan: First Kill,0,"Its creators understood that the job demands clearing a high bar for crazy, which inspires a go-for-broke pulp energy that’s appealingly ragged., Orphan: First Kill would not pass logical examination by a reasonably sentient teenager, but it has fun with its materials and does not lose sight of its one governing idea -- that every family is weird in its own peculiar way. , While there is a fair bit of blood left on the walls, floor and elsewhere, this is more of a psychological thriller than a slasher flick, and is far the better for it., This sinister sequel cant compare to its older sister flick, but its not without its own ghoulish goodies., Julia Stiles really goes for broke as the mother in this movie, which I really appreciate. , The pleasure of watching Esther out of her league is its own satisfaction, even given the dullness otherwise -- and even given the promise that some mistakes are bound to be repeated., Julia Stiles plays the matriarch, and it’s good to see this fine actress having a ball in the film’s crude but enjoyable mayhem., Coggeshall’s script isn’t especially sharp, as the movie really does hinge around that big twist, but the visual approach and performances from the actors give Orphan: First Kill an edge that should satisfy fans of the original., The force of Fuhrman’s performance – as she demonstrated in last year’s The Novice, she can be a remarkable and unsettling presence in front of a camera – goes a considerable way towards reclaiming the role of the malevolent mini psychopath Esther., The follow-up to 2009’s ‘Orphan’ uses CGI to de-age its original star, Isabelle Fuhrman, to make the 25-year-old actress resemble a child. That gimmick is just about all its got., First Kill injects plenty of camp and unhinged moments that’ll entertain, but it’s inconsistent. , Bell seems to always be willing to play it safe when this movie needed someone to embrace the insanity of its very existence., The movie is equal parts clever and trashy, made for people who like to see very good actors play people who are very bad., Esther’s rebirth is a mixed bag of blood, guts, good ideas, and missed opportunities, with that last item disappointingly dominant by a fairly substantial margin over everything else., First Kill heads down a very familiar highway before taking a huge turn off the exit toward Crazy Town, and it makes for an engaging ride thanks to a committed performance by Stiles..., The modern gothic of the first film transforms here into a perfectly fitting explosion of operatic schlock.\n\n, A guilty pleasure from the first scene to the last and should eventually become a cult classic. , While still a lurid sequel to a ropey slasher movie, Orphan: First Kill is refreshingly clever, unpredictable and gruesome. Isabelle Fuhrman’s Esther deserves three more sequels and a ‘Versus’ movie with the Stepfather or Chucky., The sheer derangement of its plot and a bizarre casting gambit make it more interesting than standard straight-to-streaming schlock., “Orphan: First Kill” is draggy and suspense-free."
The Banshees of Inisherin,0,"Martin McDonagh expertly threads humour and pathos like a master weaver who knows exactly when to change colours., The Banshees of Inisherin is not just a beautifully written screenplay. This deeply affecting, warmly humorous, beautifully acted and handsomely photographed (by Ben Davis) film is a major work and top of my list for the best film of 2022., As a comedy duo, Farrell and Gleeson are money in the bank, just as they were in McDonagh’s first feature In Bruges. As a pairing of actor and filmmaker, Farrell and McDonagh are no less in sync., Evocative cinematography and a gorgeous score make this a spellbinding men-gone-wrong fable., The film toggles masterfully between comedy and tragedy; realism and fable. It manages to be both of the moment and completely timeless., Id almost call this a horror film., Its a gut punch of a comic-drama that keeps finding new ways to land hard-hitting body blows, and its easily one of the years very best films., Condon and Keoghan give “Banshees” extra personality and verve, while Farrell and Gleeson are\xa0the two halves of its\xa0beating heart., McDonagh is a master world builder. Whether you want to live in those worlds for two hours of your only life is purely a matter of individual taste., McDonagh, Farrell, and Gleeson deliver something special, The Banshees of Inisherin unquestionably one of the year’s best films., Gleeson and Farrell revive their mesmerizing interplay, surrounded by breathtaking Irish scenery and a brilliant ensemble cast., Banshees’ dramatic resonance is a result of how deftly McDonagh delivers his characters’ virtues and vices. What’s hilarious and tragic is that both are so modest compared to the amount of anguish they cause., I think whats quite clever about the structure of the film is that McDonagh flips your allegiances in a way thats very finely balanced., Colin Farrell is a revelation in this. I think its probably his best performance ever., The word tragicomic was coined for performances, and movies, like these., “Banshees” is like a short story trying to be a novel. The extra pages get filled with the postcard views., Farrell and Gleeson are the perfect pair to give these characters the balance of humor and heartbreak., Certainly one of Farrell’s finest performances and like the film itself, his loneliness sticks in your craw like an oft-recited Irish limerick., It’s visually stunning and consistently witty while being unafraid to ask serious questions about life as it is, and should be, lived. It is proper art., Writer-director Martin McDonagh’s soulful masterpiece offers a a windswept elegy on a camaraderie that has reached its inexplicable expiration, as well as melancholic rumination on mortality."
Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules ,0,"It’s the sort of bland, innocuous trifle that will swiftly recede into the oblivion of a streaming service menu — a comedy without laughs and a family movie without heart, lacking any of the wit or charm of Kinney’s original stories."
Wrong Place,0,Wrong Place is a convoluted mess that struggles to connect disjunctive plot points as they dawdle their way to the movies inevitable conclusion.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,0,"This soulful sequel teams an emotional tribute to late star Chadwick Boseman with some spectacular visual action. A maturity milestone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starring Angela Bassett and Winston Duke., Kind of a mixed bag, but worth seeing if you liked the first one. , The MCU’s mechanics are too oppressive to allow for true mournful meditation., The first Black Panther... set a bar Wakanda Forever didnt come close to matching. But taken on its own terms, as a superhero sequel tasked with serving an unusually wide range of needs, it stands as a different kind of accomplishment., Wow! You’ll say that over and over again as this mind-blowing, superhero epic unfolds. Wow!, Wakanda Forever may not be the perfect Marvel movie, but it prove its worthiness as a bridge – not merely between Phase 4 and Phase 5... but from the bleakness of loss to a stable place from which a new generation can move forward. , The most unlikely Marvel film ever... they take these really small bites of grieving, and they can extend them and live in them, and still be able to tell an engaging action-oriented story. , I find I respect Coogler’s sequel more than I actually enjoyed it, and that’s as disappointing a turn of events as any I could have imagined., The emotional core is raw, credible and affecting., The opening and closing sequences of Wakanda Forever will make your heart ache. But at 2hrs 41mins, this is also one of the longest films in the MCU. And there are long stretches in it which border on boredom. I was weepy but also weary. , Coogler pulls off an incredible feat, despite some story stumbles, creating a superhero film that is emotionally affecting, politically and culturally urgent, and that pays loving tribute not just to T’Challa but Chadwick Boseman too., After a spate of manic superhero blockbusters that ricocheted from one digital spectacle to another, this one takes its time with character and plot but doesn’t develop either to any satisfying degree., A thoughtful and mature exploration of communal grief in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a fitting tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman., A stunning tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman., Fans of the MCU will doubtless embrace this at times moving sequel in a big way; for more serious cinemagoers this will remain a foreign country., The underwater sequences intended to visualize Talokan are drab and washed-out to the point of distraction, and even a street-level car chase shot at night is near-impossible to track, all the darkness seemingly intended to cover for lackluster CGI., Almost like being at a funeral while trying to shush the kids who are playing with their Iron Man toys. ... Its more fascinating than your average comic book movie, even though it doesnt work as a comic book movie., It can’t top the original and the absence of Chadwick Boseman hurts real bad, but Ryan Coogler’s sequel proves to be more than cringey franchise building by putting women of color in charge (yay to Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright) and watching them fly., For all its comic-book violence, over-the-top villainy, and too dark CGI, at its core this is a film about dealing with loss., “Wakanda Forever” is the first blockbuster wake, and it’s powered not by vibranium but by its vibrant and fully felt emotions."
The Minute You Wake Up Dead,0,"Any minute you spend with this shonky thriller is likely to feel about 60 seconds too long: gone for ever, never to be clawed back."
Secret Headquarters,0,"Despite its vintage Spielbergian vibes, Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman’s family-friendly escapade doesn’t bother with essential storytelling devices like world-building, emotional climaxes, or even basic character development., There\s probably enough going on in Secret Headquarters for some young audiences to have a good time, but parents, please: Have your kids\ best interests at heart and steer them elsewhere., It’s lighthearted, formulaic, and cute — your kids will like it and you can look up from the book you’re reading during the dialogue scenes., The problem with this film is that it cant decide if its for children the age of these characters 13-14 or younger 7-9, and those are different kinds of kids. You cant have both., The film seems too content to color completely within the lines. The resulting picture might be enough of a diversion for younger kids, but even they wont be missing much if whats in the movie stays secret., Secret Headquarters is as bland and forgettable as its title would suggest., There are moments of real wit (when was the last time you saw a movie use Pig Latin?), though not enough to compensate for the fairly tired, somewhat confused action sequences., It doesnt pander to teens — ahem, young adults — but rather it meets them where theyre at, and its made with warmth rather than cynicism. That makes it stand out..., With a PG-rated humor that parents can enjoy too, Secret Headquarters feels like the movie equivalent of the fun uncle who speaks to you like an adult, but also drives a mean Mario Kart., The effort strikes me as somewhat redundant., This action-adventure delivers a modicum of skill and smarts, though it ultimately winds up as forgettable as its generic title., As basic as its title."
Violent Night,0,"It’s like attending a party where no two guests are on sufficiently good terms to manage even 20 minutes of civilised conversation. “Perfect for Christmas Day then,” I hear you say. Too cynical., 112 minutes of your life rather than a day, which is a small gift..., Violent Night offers up a timely amalgam: It is torture porn that is also a morality play., Terribly violent, if you have a weak stomach, this may not be the film you want to see. , David Harbour makes a particularly good cranky, butt-kicking Santa, in a movie that offers the sort of shared experience that should bring theaters some much-needed cheer.\n\n, Behind all the gore-splattered walls and domestic rancor lies a sweet-and-sour bedtime story of good triumphing over evil., The fight scenes are competent; the gore and gunfire are plentiful, there are some reasonably clever kills, and the occasional kidding of action movie clichés are welcome. , Violent Night does exactly what it sets out to do, and does so with panache, frivolity, and style., Despite all the gore and violence and other R-rated material, it’s arguably less offensive than the kind of bilge proliferated by Netflix and Lifetime/Hallmark/etc. in the name of Holiday Cheer., Harbour’s jaded charisma is the film’s secret weapon (that and a massive hammer)., Amalgamates its spiritual ancestors for a rollicking action-comedy with its tongue—as well as a candy cane—lodged firmly in its rosy cheek., Despite refusing to tip a few scales in the favor of those attempting to rob the rich to feed themselves, Violent Night still manages to conjure its own holiday miracle—the desire for a sequel in a market glutted with them., David Harbour is perfectly cast..., The sort of wannabe cult action-comedy that gets off on its own displays of horrible behavior and listless set pieces, this Santa-goes-berserk story wants to be a new alt-holiday classic., If Violent Night had one goal — to be a Christmas movie for adults pumping with bloodlust after surviving the shopping mall parking lot — then it succeeded., If it lacks the minimalist elegance of something like Die Hard or the subversion of Bad Santa, the movie still gets its points across effectively., A largely tedious cinematic lump of coal that unsuccessfully tries to stretch its one-joke premise out to 101 minutes., The film has fun lobbing snarky one-liners and outrageous bloodshed at the audience, but on the whole, Violent Night’s big red bag of self-aware tricks is overstuffed. , Die Hard meets Miracle on 34th Street. That’s it. That’s the pitch. And most of this blood-soaked action comedy neatly fulfils those expectations., This one gets bogged down with people sitting around talking, and when we finally reach a series of climactic confrontations, they’re lazily written and thoughtlessly staged."
The Inspection,0,"The Inspection succeeds in the end because this powerful real-life character study is firmly rooted in reality., It’s Ellis’s story and Jeremy Pope keeps you on his side all the way with a performance so direct, intuitive -- and restrained -- that you feel as if he’s letting you in on his every thought., Fiercely candid, in its condemnation of the brutality that is enmeshed in the training programme, and in its celebration of the bonds and brotherhood that grow between fellow cadets., The ending is a tad contrived (it gets a bit O Captain! My Captain!), and Gabrielle Union seems slightly one-dimensional as French’s cruel and bigoted mother. But there is much to appreciate here. , The Inspection may be by the book, but the layers of personal detail and emotionally resonant core lend it an authenticity that hits home and hits hard., Some brilliant performances, but mixed messages cloud the overall impression., Gabrielle Union just blows me away. Shes in the film for about 10 minutes... but its the most amazing 10 minutes of her career. , The Inspection does feel unfocused at times, or like it\s playing the Greatest Hits of other movies that came before it. It\s not until Union\s character returns that the film comes full circle..., Observant, insistent and unsparing, wrapped around characters that feel real and rounded., It is the type of film — brave, raw and poetic — that will rightly put Bratton on the map as someone to watch, not to mention the standout performances of Jeremy Pope and Gabrielle Union., With The Inspection, Bratton has continued working with the humanist lens through which he shaped his captivating 2019 documentary Pier Kids., A stunning look at a gay man’s terrifying, triumphant time at Marines boot camp., Bratton’s unique perspective is so much more interesting when you hear him talk about “The Inspection” that you often wonder where it is when you’re watching it., A powerful, poignant, and complicated look at what people will do for acceptance., Elegance Bratton’s autobiographical story The Inspection is one of learning to accept love on one’s own terms., Jeremy Pope gives a searing performance as the young man lacking direction, with Gabrielle Union a powerful force as the mother who initially disowns him., Bratton brings a surreal, rubbed-raw realness to “The Inspection” — reflected in the performances, the film’s gritty look and unconventional style., Where most films that recount military training ultimately lead to the battlefield, this one is preparation for a different sort of combat., A well-meaning, sometimes moving, but at times exasperating movie., Bratton, who has an eye for compelling framing and unexpected beauty, has made something more complicated than a treatise against the power structures enshrined in the military, though he’s very aware of them."
