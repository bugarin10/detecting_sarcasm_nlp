For fans of the icon and his music, it hits enough sweet spots to be worthy of a theatrical viewing."", 'Elvis is propelled forward — almost maniacally so — by Presley’s music... The relentless music makes the whole thing feel like a montage...  But it’s infectious.', 'A wildly over-the-top and extremely entertaining biopic of Elvis Presley. ', 'Elvis, in the epic tradition of all of Luhrmann’s work, is a brash, overwhelming experience... It’s too much. Yet if it were any less excessive, it wouldn’t be as doggedly effective as it often is.', 'Through Luhrmann’s lens, Elvis transforms from someone striking and fresh to a relic clinging for relevancy in a changing world. Luhrmann presents the familiar narrative with enough verve to make it feel new.', 'Baz Luhrmann brilliantly floods our senses with arresting sights and sounds.', 'It’s clear Luhrmann is more interested in mythmaking, era-hopping, and genre-melding than he is in trying to dig all that deeply into the complex cultural, racial, and political realities of Presley’s life.', 'I liked it, though my corneas did feel a little crunchy afterward.', 'Swept up in the glint of the leather and the bejeweled jumpsuits, Luhrmann overlooks the messy human who hid underneath. And so, he misses out on the heart that could have made his film truly spectacular.', 'Every surface is cleanly wiped. Every fabric seems fresh out of the box. There is no journey to Vegas. We are essentially there from the opening scene.', 'Baz Luhrmann’s bejeweled battering ram of a biopic is all over the place, which  can be distracting, but the grit and grace of Austin Butler’s performance as The King is a thing of beauty. A star is born right here.']",both

Working through one of the most crushing events of his own life, Spielberg exhorts us to discover, yet again, the enduring magic of the movies.', 'Possibly the most lavishly mounted home movie ever made. Appropriately enough, that is its great strength and its fatal weakness.', 'The result is neither as sentimental nor as moving – if those adjectives can be separated – as the director’s more personal 20th century films. It does, however, feel complete in itself. Cleanly shot. Immaculately performed.', 'The Fabelmans’ fictional parts feel just as honest and revealing; seamless syntheses of life and art. That is Spielberg’s extraordinary gift: at 76, he’s still the boy cradling an entire medium in his hands.', 'This is a movie so masterfully made, you can glide along its surface without quite realising all it’s asking of you.', 'Kushner and Spielberg’s ability to turn this very personal saga into a more universal story is what sets them apart from the rest. ', 'It makes for a strangely unsatisfying movie experience, and something akin to anticipating a sumptuous and nourishing meal but being presented only with a print-out of the recipe. Some of the ingredients are nonetheless compelling... ', 'This could have been sentimental and soggy, a ""magic of the movies"" endeavour. There is some of that, but this is more than that. It’s about family, and the complexity of family, and it’s intensely personal, moving, absorbing and full of love.', 'An autopsy of a marriage and a homage to invention, it’s a bittersweet piece of joy.', 'The tone gets complicated. Adolescence often is. Flippancy aside, that is the movie’s signature: the acceptance that two things can be going on at once.', 'Spielberg has realised that fables come in all shapes and sizes. In this hilarious and heart-breaking gem, small really is beautiful.', 'A sweet but never cloying jaunt down Mr Spielberg’s memory lane.', 'The Fabelmans left me with a floating feeling of happiness.', 'What a surprise to find Spielberg, the supreme sentimentalist, occupying that murky realm. We didn’t know he had it in him.', 'There’s something disarmingly humble about The Fabelmans and the simplicity of its desire to pinpoint the ordinary roots of future greatness.', 'An affectionate and insightful peep into the inspiration and obsessions of a young filmmaker...', ""It’s a beautiful, tender and emotionally complex film, one which pays tribute to Spielberg's parents but also ensures their humanity through their flaws and failings."", 'Spielberg has packed all these things into a deceptively simple narrative which flows so smoothly that it’s easy to miss its finer points. In that sense, it crystallises his innate ability to translate the most delicate subtleties into entertainment.', 'Looking back with adult eyes, Spielberg sees his parents with all their flaws, yet infuses the film with warmth, understanding and love.']",both

Maybe the Cannes accolade was a bit on the generous side, though.', 'For Östlund, subtlety is overrated. Triangle of Sadness shows us why he has a point. It’s a spectacular demolition of modern life, a disruptor movie full of ideas and nuance, as violent in its way as a Pieter Bruegel painting.', 'Triangle of Sadness doesn’t leave audiences with much to unpack thematically, but it’s clear-eyed and hilarious about the systems that enforce societal inequities and what might happen if they were ever to unravel.', 'There is scarcely a gag or scenario that isn’t telegraphed and obvious, and yet it’s seemingly just as satisfied with its own cleverness as its targets are with their over-pampered, empty lives.', ""There's great heady stuff going on and also really weird fun in this film too.
